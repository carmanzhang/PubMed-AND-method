Aminer data take from OAG

OAG is generated by linking two large academic graphs: Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and AMiner.
OAG is released under ODC-BY license. In mid 2017, we published OAG v1, which contains 166,192,182 papers from MAG and 154,771,162 papers from AMiner (see below) and generated 64,639,608 linking (matching) relations between the two graphs. This time, in OAG v2, author, venue and newer publication data and the corresponding matchings are available. It can be used as a unified large academic graph for studying citation network, paper content, and others, and can be also used to study the integration of multiple academic graphs.
OAG v2 is available now. Please check https://www.aminer.org/oag2019 for details.
