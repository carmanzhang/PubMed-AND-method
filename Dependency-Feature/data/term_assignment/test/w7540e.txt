<title>Wildlife and food security in Africa. Wildlife utilization and food security in Africa</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
The gathering, compiling and dissemination of information on wildlife utilisation and economics have always been basic activities of the FAO Forestry Department. In the African region such endeavours have been encouraged and supported by the Working Party on Wildlife Management and National Parks of the African Forestry and Wildlife Commission at a number of its sessions. As a result, FAO commissioned Professor S.S. Ajayi to compile the document Utilisation of Forest Wildlife in West Africa, which was completed in 1979.
Subsequently Dr E.O.A. Asibey prepared, in 1986, a document entitled Wildlife and Food Security, which furnished the basis for the keynote address he delivered at the Symposium on Wildlife Management in Sub-Saharan Africa hosted by Zimbabwe (Harare 1987), with technical support from FAO.
The present study was initially intended to edit the document compiled by Dr Asibey for publication. However, on examination of the document recently, it was realised that most of the data it contained were rather outdated, and that the document drew heavily on data from other parts of the world which were not necessarily applicable to the African situation. It therefore became necessary to prepare a completely new document, focusing mainly on potential contribution of wildlife to food security in Africa.
FAO is grateful to the author, Yaa Ntiamoa-Baidu, for the considerable effort she has put into this exercise which has resulted in a well-documented and informative work. The FAO Forest Resources Division, Rome, Italy and the FAO Regional Office for Africa, Accra, Ghana would welcome comments and suggestions on this document for an eventual updated edition.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Definitions and scope of the study
Food security is defined as physical and economic access to food for all people at all times (Hoskins, 1990). Food security is therefore primarily concerned with food availability; and lack of food security ultimately reflects on the nutritional status of individuals. However, although the nutritional well-being of an individual is primarily determined by food availability, food security is influenced by a range of factors other than food availability, including economic and social status, health (physical/spiritual/mental), education and cultural biases (see Box 1). In looking at the role of wildlife in food security in Africa. we are concerned not only with the direct contribution of wildlife as a food resource, but also with the influence of wildlife on access to food through employment and income generation, its influence on physical, spiritual and cultural well-being of people. as well as its positive and negative influences on food production capabilities (see Box 2).
In less-developed countries, particularly in Africa, famine and malnutrition are serious perennial problems that nations have to grapple with. It is estimated that by the end of 1989. approximately 552 million people went to bed hungry each day. The situation does not appear to be improving; the current trend is that of increasing human populations, and inequity in resource distribution and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, which is leading to large scale destruction of the world's productive systems. The predictions are that without concerted efforts to reverse these trends, the world will experience increasing under-nutrition and will witness starvation on a yet unknown scale in times of periodic drought or crop failures. According to a recent analysis by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO, 1995), the situation in Africa is becoming increasingly critical as conventional agriculture fails to meet expectations and the capacity of
countries to import food is low due to scarcity of foreign exchange resources. As a consequence, one third of the population in Africa is chronically undernourished, and rural populations in many areas of Africa are already compelled by socio-economic stresses to use all the natural resources available. Thus, species which were not normally exploited for food or were eaten only by children as snacks are now important items in the family diet and/or trade
To achieve food security under the current food situation and nutritional problems in Africa, a holistic and integrated approach to agricultural development is crucial. One path to solving the food security problem is to broaden the spectrum of crops cultivated and animals husbanded on the continent to include non-traditional species such as wildlife, and to develop new and innovative production systems to complement the conventional systems.
Box 1 FOOD SECURlTY: DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT
The concept of food security used in its most general form essentially means a state of affairs where all people at all times: have access to safe and nutritious food so as to maintain a healthy and active:: life. This: is the definition endorsed by a number of authorities (see em, FAO/WHO, 1992; USAID, 1992; Petit and Gnaegy, 1994). FAO) has operationalized the Concept within its mandate: by stressing those aspects of the phenomenon that are related to the availability and stability of food: supplies at the national level,: through both time and space and access to food supplies at the household: and individual, as well as national level. The latter considerations are expressed in the definition of household food security accepted by the Committee on World Food Security as "physical and economic access to adequate food for all household members without undue risk of losing such access."
Although the Consequences of food insecurity flare reflected ultimately on the individuals nutritional status, it must be born in mind that the nutritional status of an individual is: also influenced by processes that determine the allocation of: food within the household, its intake by the individual: end its subsequent physiological utilisation. In other words, health, 'sanitary, educational, economic, social, gender and cultural factors all play a part in influencing what is essentially the nutritional well-being of the individual. Ideally? Therefore? measures of food security should contain information having a bearing on the nutritional status of individuals, while somehow controlling for the effects of other factors that may also influence nutritional status.
Traditionally, information on the: availability of food at some aggregate level and on the structure of its distribution among households has been used for measuring and monitoring the status of food security. Despite problems related to their accuracy, national food balance sheets and nutritional and/for consumption surveys are the most readily available sources for such in formation. In fact, FAO estimates* of the prevalence of under-nutrition in developing countries and of the Aggregate Household Food Security lndex (AHFSI) which are essentially based on them, make direct use of such data (FAO 1992). In these food security measurements, the most important component of these measurements are the annual estimates of per caput food availability in terms of caIories, from both domestic production and net imports (including food aid), obtained from national food balance sheets (FAO 1993).
*The estimates reflect the number of chronically undernourished, who, on average in the course of a year, have food intake below that required to maintain body weight and support light activity. The threshold level is assumed to be equal to 1.54 times the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
Box 2 FACTORS RELATED TO FOOD SECURITY AND THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION FROM WILDLIFE RESOURCES.
The need to develop the value of African wildlife was recognised as far back as the 1950s and 1960s. The development of wildlife as a natural resource in Africa featured on the agenda of meetings of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) at Athens in 1958, at Warsaw in 196O, at Arusha in 1961 and at Nairobi in 1963; and a decision to incorporate wildlife conservation in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's regular activities was taken in 1959 (Riney 1964, 1970). Unfortunately, despite all these concerns, very little investment and research effort have gone into the development of wildlife as a food resource as compared with inputs into conventional agriculture.
Bushmeat was one of main sources of food and virtually the sole source of animal protein far people in pre-historic times. Civilisation and agricultural development over millennia has drastically reduced people's dependence on bushmeat as a source of food in many parts of the world. In Africa, however, bushmeat continues to contribute substantially to the total animal protein supply. In countries such as Botswana and Zaire, much of the meat consumed is bushmeat and in the majority of West African states, bushmeat is the preferred meat and has a higher retail value than domestic meat in urban markets. In addition to being a highly preferred food item in many areas of Africa, wild animal foods are life-saving reserves in times of food shortage and hunger. The importance of caterpillars, beetles and termites as key sources of food in times of famine is particularly well documented for communities in the Central African sub-region (see e.g. Wilson, 1990; McGregor, 1991; Takeda &
Sato, 1993).
Wildlife also contributes significantly to household incomes in both rural and urban communities through hunting, crafts and trade based on wildlife products; and to national economies through tourism and sale of wild animal products.
The contribution of wildlife to food security and nutritional well-being in Africa is also manifested in the spiritual, cultural and medicinal values placed on wild animals by rural African communities. Many such communities still depend on wild animals and their products, used alone or with herbs, for medication and the treatment of a wide variety of ailments ranging from mental and physical illnesses to ante-natal care, while a wide range of wild animal species have spiritual and cultural associations (Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1987; 1992)
Despite the obvious contribution of wildlife to the socio-economic life in Africa, there are currently no comprehensive and reliable estimates on total supply, trade and consumption of wildlife in any African country. Studies on bushmeat exploitation and consumption are restricted by logistics to specific areas or groups of people in a particular country (e.g. Lahm, 1993 in Gabon; Ichikawa, 1993 and Takeda & Sato, 1993 in Zaire; Dei, 1989; 1991 in Ghana); and available data on bushmeat trade are limited to a few market centres (e. g. Asibey. 1978 and Falconer, 1992 in Ghana, Martin, 1983 in Nigeria). Hunters also often conceal their catch to evade tax and/or wildlife laws. Outputs and services like those related to enhancement of the spiritual well-being, medication and cultural values are even more difficult to quantify e.g. the total number of people dependent on traditional medicine for health care and annual cost of such treatment is not known precisely for any African
country
Definitions and scope of the study
"Wildlife", as used in this work is defined in the narrow sense to mean "wild animals" and includes both invertebrate and vertebrate animals, but excludes fish (which is being covered under a separate exercise commissioned by FAO to look at the role fisheries in food security); reference is made to fish in this work only where it is necessary to illustrate a point. Traditionally, "game" is used to refer to large mammals hunted for food, trophy or sport. In Africa, all species of wild animals, ranging from insects through reptiles, rodents to large mammals, are acceptable as a food resource. Therefore the word "Bushmeat" (which originated from West Africa and refers to meat of wild animals) is used in this work to refer to wild animals hunted/collected for food, while "game" is used in reference to animals hunted for sport or trophy. The work covers sub-Saharan Africa but excludes Madagascar and other islands geographically associated with Africa.
In chapters 2 and 3 of the document. we present data and evidence to illustrate the direct and indirect contribution of wildlife to food security in Africa through wildlife use as a food resource and as a source of income and other human needs (see Box 3?. In chapter 4. the present wildlife production systems are examined; and finally in chapter 5 we argue the case for more investment and long term commitment from African governments and multilateral aid agencies to the development of Africa's wildlife resources to complement conventional agricultural production.

2.1.1 Bushmeat
Bushmeat is an important source of animal protein in both rural and urban households throughout Africa (see Box 4). The magnitude of exploitation and consumption, however varies from country to country and is determined primarily by its availability, but is also influenced by governmental controls on hunting, socio-economic status and cultural prohibitions. In areas where wildlife still exists people collect, hunt or purchase and eat bushmeat for a variety of reasons. Some people depend on bushmeat for their animal protein supply because they have no other source or cannot afford alternative sources; others eat bushmeat as a matter of preference or as a luxury item/delicacy to be eaten on special occasions. For the former group, all species of wild animals are accepted as comestible. while the latter group will go to great lengths and are willing to pay high prices for their choice species. The reality in Africa, is that for the greater majority of rural people, bushmeat
represents a vital dietary item for a complex combination of reasons dictated by lack of alternate sources. financial limitations, preference and cultural values. For such people, wild animals constitute a valuable food resource which cannot be easily withdrawn or replaced without causing wide-ranging socio-economic imbalances.
Within the West African sub-region where utilization of wild animals and their products is particularly well documented ( see e.g. Asibey, 1965; 1966a; 1974; 1977; 1978; Ajayi, 1973; 1974; 1979; Sale, 1981; Martin, 1983; Jeffery, 1977; Ntiamoa-Baidu 1987) bushmeat is eaten by all classes of people and is preferred to domestic meat. In southern Africa, the Bushmen do not keep any domestic stocks and rely heavily on wild animals for their protein (Maliehe, 1993). Most of the meat eaten in Botswana is bushmeat, although the proportion of wild to domestic meat in people's diets varies within the country. For instance all the meat eaten by the hunting and gathering groups such as the San is bushmeat, whereas the cattle-ranching, tribesmen may get about 80% of their meat from wild animals and the rest from livestock (Butynski & Richter, 1972; Prescott-Allen & Prescott-Allen, 1982). A study of the diet of Kwango-Kwilu villages in Zaire (Kukwikila et al., 1993) showed that the main
source of protein was forest game, freshwater fish and insects especially caterpillars and grasshoppers which were particularly abundant in the period of food shortage (December-January). Among the Zairian Ntomba people. the first meat introduced to a baby is fat and liver from hoofed game species such as the blue duiker Cephalophus monticola and bushpig Potamochoerus porcus, which were introduced when the baby is between 4-9 months, with caterpillars being introduced from 12 to 14 months of age (Pagezy, 1993). In Tanzania, people living around forests and grasslands are provided with food security in the form of cheap bushmeat (Chihongo, 1992) and in all regions of Malawi, wild animal food such as caterpillars, honey, termites and meat of large mammals are exploited for food (Nyirenda, 1993)
A considerable amount of work was done in the 1970s and early 1980s to document bushmeat consumption. particularly in West Africa. The data on consumption however, were mostly based on estimates of the number of people who eat bushmeat or on estimates of bushmeat contribution to national protein supply. Some of the earlier studies in the region gave annual wild animal consumption figures ranging from 20% of the animal protein among rural people living in Nigeria's rain forest areas as compared with 13% in the whole country, to 75 % in rural Ghana compared to 9.2% nationally, 70-80 % in Cameroon's forest zone compared with 2.8 % for the entire country and as much as 80-90 % in Liberia (Ajayi, 1979; Asibey, 1977). The basis for these estimates were often questionable and some authors have attributed the high figures to "over-enthusiastic advocacy of the value of bushmeat".
Some more recent data are available on bushmeat consumption in individual households and communities in a few areas within Africa e.g., a survey conducted in 1987 in Bukavu, Zaire indicated that 72% of the population in the town consumed bushmeat regularly and the yearly bushmeat consumption of the town was estimated at 400 tons (Keita, 1993). Bushmeat consumption in Côte d'Ivoire was estimated at 83,000 tons in 1990, valued at US$117,000,000 (Feer, 1993) and in Liberia, it is estimated that three quarters of the country's meat production comes from bushmeat, with subsistence hunting yielding as much as 105,000 tons of meat annually (Anstey, 1991). Estimates of meat consumption in Cameroon in 1981 was 33.1 kg per person per year or 9 gm per day, of which bushmeat accounted for 8.8 %, with 34.1 % coming from fish and the rest from domestic sources (beef, 27.5%; pigs, 9%; sheep and goats, 6.2 %; dairy products, eggs and imported animal products, 10.4) The proportion supplied
by bushmeat represented 28,500 tons of bushmeat per year (Gartlan, 1987). Among village communities, Infield (1988) estimated bushmeat consumption of 100 kg per person per year in villages around the Korup National Park (Cameroon) as compared to a consumption of 250 gm per adult per week in a Ghanaian village, Akyem Ayirebi (Del, 1991). Consumption levels ranging from 67333 g (modal class 100- 150 g) per person per meal were recorded at chop bars in the city of Accra (Tutu et al.., 1993). The minimum quantity eaten per person at one sitting (i.e. 67 g) was 175% of the per caput daily protein intake in Ghana (FAO, 1986) and 120% of the daily nutritional requirement.
Studies on volume of bushmeat production in Africa tend to be restricted to small areas and the only indication of volume of bushmeat produced by countries are the estimates published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These estimates based on the limited records reported to Wildlife Departments or on food consumption surveys such as those reported by FAO. The limitation of such data is that they neither capture the actual volume of bushmeat exploited nor cover the entire range of species taken. Species such as rodents, snails and insects, which are often consumed by the hunter and his family, hardly appear in the markets and therefore do not appear in the statistics. The situation is amply described by Prescott-Allen & Prescott-Allen (1982) in the statement "when a hunter sells his catch to a neighbour or pops it into the family pot, he rarely tells a statistician."
A number of factors contribute to the scarcity and incompleteness of data on wildlife consumption. These include:
o the widely dispersed nature of bushmeat supply sources in Africa and the fact that supply sources are mostly in remote areas far from the city centres where the government statistician or wildlife officer is based;
o the fact that a large proportion of the bushmeat taken is either used to feed the family or is sold locally;
o illiteracy, most hunters are illiterate and do not keep records of their catch;
o the limited infrastructure: facilities for recording bushmeat off-take and sales are often undeveloped or at best inadequate.
Bushmeat production estimates published by FAO for selected countries are reproduced in Table 2.1, which also gives the contribution of bushmeat to daily protein intake. These estimates are based on very limited data and have value for comparisons between different countries rather than as absolute production figures. In the same vein, the figures for bushmeat consumption do not reflect the real situation that pertains in many rural African communities. The need for more studies in this area cannot be over-emphasised.

Box 4. WILDLIFE AS FOOD RESOURCE IN AFRICA
Country West Africa
Use of Bushmeat as a food resource
Benin Bushmeat is commonly sold in markets and is preferred to meat of domestic animals. The grasscutter (cane rat), Thryonomys swinderianus is the favourite species for most people (Baptist & Mensah; 1986). Bushmeat production was estimated at 20,000 tonnes valued at 40 million F CFA in 1989.
Cameroon Bushmeat is an important part of the diet of many urban and rural Cameroonians providing an estimated 70-80 % of animal protein consumed in the southern areas (Ajayi, 1979; Belisle, 1987). Species consumed include snails, caterpillars and other insects. 8.8% of the estimated 33.1 kg of meat consumed annually by each Cameroonian was contributed by bushmeat (Gartlan; 1987).
Ghana All species of wild animal are accepted as food resource. Asibey (1977) estimated that 70 % of Ghanaians ate bushmeat and wild animals constituted the main source of animal protein for rural communities. Recent surveys of meat consumption indicated that bushmeat is still popular, over 90 % of people interviewed would eat bushmeat if it were available (Falconer, 1992, Ntiamoa-Baidu 1992, Tutu et al.., 1996). A total of 3,682 bushmeat carcasses weighing 13,884.6 kg were recorded in three bushmeat market centres in Kumasi over a 27 day period in 1991 (Falconer, 1992)
Liberia Popular species exploited as bushmeat were antelopes and various species of monkeys (Jeffrey, 1977; Verschuren, 1983). Estimates in the 1970s indicated that bushmeat contributed between 60-90 % of the animal protein consumed (Ajayi, 1979; Sale, 1981). A more recent survey estimates that three quarters of the country's meat production comes from wild animals. Subsistence hunting yielded 105 tonnes of meat valued at US$42 m (Anstey, 1991)
Nigeria Wildlife is typically viewed as bushmeat. Bushmeat is popular with both urban and city dwellers and provides 20 % of animal protein in southern Nigeria. The most commonly consumed species are small mammals including squirrels, grasscutters, giant rats, brush-tailed porcupines and bats (Ajayi, 1979; Martin, 1983; 1984; Anadu, 1987). An estimated total of 1,320,000 metric tonnes of bushmeat was hunted by farmers in three ecological zones, within a six month period (Adeola & Decker 1987)
Senegal Consumption of bushmeat was estimated at 373,600 metric tonnes per year (Cremoux, 1963). A more recent survey in the Sine region gave consumption among the Sereer of 12.9 g per person per day as compared with 24 g domestic meat/person/day. Most common species consumed were birds and the greatest quantities were consumed by children (Vincke et al., 1987)
Sierra Leone Bushmeat was once a staple food in many Sierra Leonean's diets. Despite the increasing scarcity of wildlife throughout the country, bushmeat is available in most rural and urban markets and 55% of all households regularly consume bushmeat (Smith' 1979; Teleki et al: 1981)
Eastern and Central Africa :
CAR For the Aka Pygmies, bunting is an essential way of life (Motte-Florac, Bushmeat is not only the main source of protein, but also provides income and an item to barter for carbohydrate food items.
Gabon Game is sold or consumed depending on the size, personal and public appeal. Small pangolins and rodents are eaten locally white porcupines, duikers, lizards and crocodiles are more popular on the bushmeat markets (Lahm, 1993
Tanzania Game meat is a source of cheaper protein for rural as well as urban populations and is of vital importance particularly for people living around parks and reserves (Chihongo, 1992)
Zaire 72% of the population in the town of Bukavu consume bushmeat regularly and the annual bushmeat consumption in the town was estimated at 400 tons in 1987 (Keita, 1993). Hunter-gatherers living in the forest areas obtain all their animal protein Ironic the forest and up to 200 animal species ranging from large and medium sized animal, to birds, reptile and insects are exploited for food (lchikawa, 1993)
Southern Africa 
Botswana The majority of animal protein comes from wild animals of every kind and size including not only what is traditionally considered as game but meat of all mammal including predators, birds and their eggs, bats and insects virtually every animal is edible (Richter, 1970; Butynski & Richter, 1972). Over 50 species of wild animals are hunted for food, providing 90.7 kg per annum per person in some areas, equivalent to 40% of the diet. (Child, 1970)
Malawi In all regions of Malawi wild animal food such as caterpillars, honey' termites and game meat are exploited for food (Nyirenda, 1993)
South Africa For rural communities living in the vicinity of forests, natural woodlands and forest,. fallow areas, wild animals often play a significant role in local diets; in some case, they provide tile single largest source of animal protein. Hunting of large game animals is legally forbidden but various species including genets, field mice, rock hyrax, porcupines, bush pigs and hares are hunted for food. Monkeys are particularly relished by the Zulus. Reptiles and amphibians suck as lizards, leguaans (Varanus sp.) tortoises, a number of snakes including venomous ones like the puff adder (Bitis sp.) frogs and toads are regarded as delicacies (Maliehe, 1993)
Zimbabwe In addition to large mammals which are hunted Illegally, rodents and birds are used extensively in all small scale farming areas. Honey and insects are collected and eaten by almost all households important edible insects include termites, caterpillars and some grasshoppers (McGregor, 1991; Wilson, 1990)
An attempt to estimate bushmeat production over a wider area was made by Adeola & Decker (1987) who conducted a survey on utilisation of bushmeat by farmers and hunters in three ecological regions (rain forest, deciduous forest and Savannah) in Nigeria. Bushbucks and duikers were found to be the main large mammal species harvested in all three ecological regions and provided 6.1 animals per month in the Savannah zone as compared with 4.9 in the deciduous forest and 3.6 in the rain forest. Small mammals formed the bulk of animals exploited. Of the small mammals, three rodents, the grasscutter (cane rat), giant rat and squirrels were the most abundant providing 41.7 animals per month in the savannah, 27.5 in the deciduous forest and 26.2 in the rain forest (Table 2.2). The study estimated that a total of 1.263,000 metric tons of bushmeat, comprising small and large mammals but excluding elephants, were harvested by the farmers per month during the rainy season. This was made
up of 696,000 metric tons from the savannah region, 183,000 from the deciduous forest region and 385,000 tons from the rain forest region.
Despite the lack of precise estimates on bushmeat consumption and total production, the fact remains that bushmeat is one of the most valued and preferred animal protein items in both rural and urban diets in many parts of Africa. Recent studies in Ghana (e.g., Falconer, 1990; 1992, Ntiamoa-Baidu 1992) showed that over 90% of the people interviewed in both urban and rural areas would eat bushmeat if it were available and for approximately 40-70% of the people, bushmeat was the preferred meat (Fig.1). The popularity of bushmeat was confirmed by the results of a survey of the meat preference of customers visiting chop bars (traditional restaurants) in Accra, where they had a choice of various types of meat and fish dishes (Tutu et. al., 1993); 65% of the 374 visitors to the chop bars selected bushmeat dishes
Unlike areas in Central Africa where bushmeat is still relatively abundant and accounts for the greater proportion of household animal protein consumption, the actual contribution to total protein intake in West Africa is presently very low. Bushmeat was not a regular part of the diet of over 70 % of the people interviewed in the Ghana study by Tutu et al., (1993) and bushmeat contributed less than 5% of the total animal protein intake in both rural and urban communities. Fish accounted for the greatest proportion of animal protein intake (Fig. 2). The current low contribution of bushmeat to the protein intake in the region was attributed to scarcity, relatively high prices and the unavailability in small affordable pieces, particularly in the rural areas' since most of the hunters catch were sold as whole animals to be retailed in city markets. Thus, whereas in the past bushmeat was the most common source of animal protein, it is currently a luxury item, eaten only
occasionally in most homes, and for those who relish bushmeat but cannot afford the cost of purchasing it for use in their homes, the chop bars remain their main source of bushmeat dishes. The scarcity of bushmeat has resulted in a situation where any wild animal is acceptable as comestible and people have resorted to exploiting and marketing whatever they can find including a variety of small animals which in the past were not eaten at all or were only eaten by children.

2.1.2 Other wild animal products
In addition to the contribution of bushmeat to food security through direct consumption, wild animals and their products are used as condiments to make meals more palatable, thereby improving the capacity of people to eat sufficient quantities of staple foods which are often bland and monotonous. Honey, produced by honey-bees, is regarded as valuable product worldwide. It may be used as a source of food, as a sweetener, as a tonic or medicine, and also as base for producing beverages. In many African communities, e.g. among the Maasai, honey also has an important social value in that it is used in various ceremonies such as marriage and circumcision (Chihongo, 1992).
Honey is collected from the wild or produced on bee-keeping farms. It is estimated that there are approximately 2000 bee farmers in South Africa and honey production is reported at 3,200 metric tons per year (Maliehe, 1993). Bee keeping is obviously an industry with a lot of income generation potential for the rural people? particularly those living in the vicinity of protected areas where the low population pressure makes the reserves excellent for bee-keeping. Bee-keeping provides one economic justification for the sustainable management of the natural forests. Thus a number of "people and parks" projects in Africa are exploring or encouraging bee-keeping by local communities within reserves as a way of increasing benefits from the forests to the people and thereby enhance both food and income/employment based on forest industries. The honey produced may be consumed locally' transported to city markets for sale or exported.

2.2 Species and varieties of wild animals eaten
Virtually all species of wild animals are acceptable as a food resource to some group of people in Africa. Species which may be tabooed by one group of people are a delicacy to another group elsewhere. Species eaten vary from antelopes to monkeys, rodents. reptiles and a whole range of invertebrate species including snails, termites and beetles. Jardin (1970) lists hundreds of species belonging to 236 genera reported to be eaten by people in Africa. Bushmeat is eaten as fresh meat, smoked, salted or sun dried (biltong). Smoking is the most widespread form of preservation and smoked bushmeat is available in urban markets in most African countries.
The range of species taken and relative importance of the different species have been documented for several areas of the continent and vary from locality to locality depending mainly on the species available for exploitation in each region and also on hunting restrictions enforced in each county. Rodents are particularly important in terms of range of species and numbers taken in many parts of Africa, possibly because they are not subject to hunting restrictions in many countries and also the fact that their high reproductive capacity makes them relatively more abundant. A comparison of the use of mammalian species in relation to species occurrence in different environments and the subsistence base of the people living in those environments showed that hunter-gatherer communities living in forest environments used a wider range of the species available to them, while pastoralist communities living in dry environments used only a limited number of species (Table 2.3).

Detailed studies on diet composition have been carried out for several groups of people living in west-central Africa. Tables 2.4 and 2.5 provide some indication of the range of wild animals used as food for three ethnic groups in Zaire: the Mbuti (hunter-gatherers inhabiting the Ituri forest of Zaire) and the Ngandu and Boyela (sub-groups of the Mongo people inhabiting the central part of Zaire). The Mbuti used more than 200 animal species as food. All large and medium-sized mammalian species and all birds occurring in their area (with the exception of swallows, wagtails, owls and night jars), seven species of reptiles, 29 species of insects (larvae and/or adults) and about 20 species of fish were considered as comestibles. The Ngandu and Boyela people on the other hand, exploited two hundred and eighty five species of wild animal species comprising mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects as food resources. The frequency of insect consumption showed marked
seasonality although species such as the winged elates of, termites (Macrotermes sp.) were available in varying degrees of abundance all year round (Takeda & Sato, 1993)

Lahm ( 1993) recorded 254 species of wild animals harvested by hunters and trappers in three villages in north-eastern Gabon. Ungulates accounted for 57.5% of the catch with the blue duiker Cephalophus monticola being the most common species taken. Primates formed the second most important prey group; Cercopithecus nictitans was the most frequently harvested species. Of the rodents, the brush-tailed porcupine Atherurus africanus was the most common species taken, being second in numerical importance of all the species harvested (Table 2.6). The differences in the numerical abundance of the species harvested was attributed to the relative abundance of the different species in the locality, their accessibility as well as factors such as dietary taboos, small size, cryptic behaviour and activity patterns.
Species such as monitor lizards (Varanus sp.), frogs and toads, turtles and tortoises and several species of snakes, including venomous ones such as the Puff-adder (Bitts sp.) are regarded as delicacies among many African communities in southern Africa, while caterpillars and a number of moth species are relished in rural communities (Maliehe, 1993). The range of species harvested is particularly diverse in West Africa, including a wide range of rodents and other small mammals and invertebrate species, perhaps due to the scarcity of larger mammals. African giant snails (Achatina sp. and Archachatina sp.) are popular among both urban and rural dwellers in West Africa (Ajayi, 1971; Anadu, 1987; Afolayan & Ajayi, 1983; Osemeobo, 1992). Snails are most abundant in the forest areas of the region during the rainy season when they are heavily exploited for food.
Despite the seemingly wide range of wild animal species exploited for food within the region, people have clear preferences. The grasscutter is undoubtedly the most important bushmeat species throughout West Africa in terms of volume of trade and preference (Fig 3 and Tables 3.6-3.8). In a survey of meat preferences in Ghana 40-50% of the people interviewed in various towns considered the grasscutter to be the most favourite species and 76% of people eating bushmeat in chop bars in Accra selected grasscutter meat. The grasscutter was followed by the royal antelope Neotragus pygmaeus. In contrast, large rodents other than the brush-tailed porcupine are less important dietary items in Gabon and other areas within the central African sub-region where significant large mammal populations still exist.

2.3 Nutritional value meat from wild animals
A number of studies on the nutritional value of wild animal meat indicate that bushmeat is comparable if not better than domestic meat. The general trend is that the meat of most wild animal species tends to be low in fat, while equal or better than beef, mutton, chicken or pork in protein content and much higher in vitamin content (Tables 2.7 and 2.8). Apart from the large game species, nutritional studies on wild animals have been carried out for "non-conventional" species such as rodents, insects and snails. Nutritional studies of rodents used as food in the Zambezian woodland gave average protein content of 24% (fresh weight); fat content of 2.816.8% and ash consent of % for twelve species (Malaise and Parent 1982, see Table 2.7). Based on these results, the authors concluded that the nutritive value of rodents places them on the same level as beef and chicken.
Several species of insects used for food in Africa have high protein and calorific value (see e.g., Hickin, 1971). Larvae of the silkworm Anaphe venata, which is used extensively for food in rural Nigeria, was found to contain more crude protein than other animal sources such as lamb and pork. The iron (Fe) content was superior to chicken and the larvae also contained six of the eight amino acids essential to the human body, threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenyl-alanine and lysine, thus making A. venata a useful supplement to protein and mineral deficient diets (Ashiru, 1988). With a fat content of only 1.3 % and iron content of 12.2 mg/100g in edible carcass, the nutritive value of snails is reported to be comparable to that of domestic livestock (Ajayi et al., 1978)

3.1.5 Live animal trade
Trade in bushmeat and wildlife products as well as wildlife based industries contribute significantly to both national and household food security through the generation of financial resources which can be used directly to purchase food or to develop and improve food production systems (see Boxes 5 & 6). The main contribution of wildlife to African macro-economies comes from wildlife-based tourism, recreation and associated industries. There is a point of view that the greater proportion of income from tourism in African countries goes to foreign owned airlines and hotels, however, it is also obvious that the tourist industry in Africa offers employment to a significant number of local people, thereby contributing to household income and access to food.
Apart from the income generated through direct employment in wildlife based ventures. wildlife also contributes directly to household income through hunting, trade in bushmeat, trophies. skins and hides, as well as sale of live animals and craftwork based on wild animal products. Bushmeat is often used as an item of barter for carbohydrate food resources and essential household items. Markets for bushmeat and other wild animal products help to fuel rural economies and provide income sources for the rural communities, who often have very few other avenues for earning cash income and for whom income from wild products is essential for the provision of everyday needs. Hunting and bushmeat trade involves several levels of participants, from hunters to middlemen and meat processors and therefore provides income not only for hunters but a wide cross-section of both rural and urban communities. Even among communities where the main occupation is farming, income from
hunting/collection of wild animals and wild animal products often represent a substantial proportion of the household income which cannot be easily removed without causing significant hardships. A large proportion of rural populations in Africa live on the edge of poverty and have to struggle to survive. Under such conditions even small incomes such as that derived from seasonal collection of snails by women could determine whether or not a child continues school, since without this there would be no money to pay school fees. The story of well educated people in very important positions whose education was funded through the regular and continuing collection and sale of wildlife products by their illiterate mothers is not uncommon in Africa.
3.1.1 Tourism and recreation
Wildlife based tourism is particularly well developed in eastern and southern Africa where the industry contributes significantly to national incomes and is a key foreign currency earner in a number of countries. Kenya is cited as the most successful African country in terms of tourism development and the industry earns approximately US$ 600 million a year, an income exceeded only by that from coffee (Table 3.1). Using a computer model based on projected number of visitors to the Amboseli National Park in Kenya over a 15 year period, Thresher (1991) argues convincingly that it is more profitable to both the nation and individual households to protect game animals for tourism than for consumptive uses. Thresher's model estimates that a single maned lion in the Amboseli Park was worth US$ 515,000 as a tourist resource for game viewing as compared with $8,500 if it was used as a resource for hunting or sport and only $960 to $1,325 if used as a commercial resource (i.e.? the
market value of a well-cured lion skin). For individual landowners participating in a group ranch scheme and who received benefits from the state after cost deductions, income derived from the maintenance of a lion on their ranch as tourist resource was $91,000 as compared with $600 paid out as hunting fees if the lion was sold out for sport hunting and $250 if hunted for the skin.
Box 5 CONTRIBUTION OF WILDLIFE-BASED INDUSTRIES TO AFRICAN ECONOMIES
Country
Wildlife in the national economy
Kenya Tourism is the second highest foreign exchange earner providing about $600 million annually (Eltringham, 1994).
CAR Bushmeat contributes 37 billion CFA Fr of annual revenue and accounts for a little over 10 % of the GDP (Keita, 1993).
Zimbabwe Tourism and wildlife based industries earned between Z$300 million to Z$1 billion in recent years and contributed 2-5% of CDP (Muir, 19943.
Namibia An average of 1,500 clients each accompanied by a mean of 1.75 observers are handled annually by the Namibian Professional Hunting Association. In 1991 an estimated total of R44 million was earned as foreign exchange from trophy fees, accommodation, airfares and trophy export charges (Yaron et al., 1994).
South Africa Tourism, which is for the greater part nature-based, is the fifth highest foreign exchange earner yielding approximately SAR 2.5 billion, equivalent to some $800 million in 1992 and provided jobs for 300,000 people (Koch, 1994).
Wildlife based activities, including tourism, trade in trophies, meat and live animals, contributed about 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Tanzania in 1989 - 1991, with tourism earning the greatest proportion of the national revenue. A total of Tsh 9.6 million was collected as revenue from game meat and trophies from the operations of the Tanzania Wildlife Corporation in 1991 (Chihongo, 1992). Tourism is the third highest foreign exchange earner for Zimbabwe after mining and agriculture and the country also receives considerable revenue from safari hunting and sale of live animals and trophies (Table 3.2). Wildlife and scenic attractions are reported to be the main backbone of the tourist industry and the industry is estimated to be 95% nature based (Campbell and Brigham 1993). Gross income from sport hunting rose steadily from a little over US$2 million in 1984 to $9.3 million in 1990 when safari concessions on communal lands alone was estimated at US$3.8 million
(summing, 1990). Local households benefit from the revenue either as direct dividends paid to individual households (thus contributing to household income and access to food) and/or from the provision of communal facilities which contribute to the development and general well-being of the community. In addition, households also benefit directly from the meat provided by culling operations.
Tourism was the fifth highest foreign exchange earner in South Africa in 1990 (Koch, 199 4) According to a release from the government, over 90% of foreign tourists come to South Africa primarily to enjoy the country s scenery, flora and fauna. It is estimated that foreign tourism earned some SAR 2.5 billion (equivalent to approximately US$ 800 million) and provided jobs for 300,000 people. Compared to other sectors, this meant that one out of every 14 actively employed people in South Africa worked in the tourism industry.

Several innovative measures have been initiated, particularly in southern and eastern Africa, to return some of the benefits gained from wildlife-based tourism to communities living around national parks and other protected areas. This provides an incentive for local communities to protect wildlife resources. The measures include bed-night levies on hotel occupancy communal ventures in tourist camp/lodge operations, development of communal lands and group ranches for tourism. The profits from such ventures are either shared among households or invested in community infrastructure such as schools, wells, health centres etc. For many years, the revenue derived from wildlife resources of the Lower Lupande Game Management Area (Luangwa valley, Zambia) was paid into the Central Treasury just as it happens in many areas in Africa. Now, the establishment of a revolving fund allows local people to benefit from the income generated by wildlife-based activities. In 1987, the total
revenue from safari hunting, hippo utilisation and other related activities amounted to US $ 48 620, out of which $4,596 went to local community projects. The benefits to the local communities increased to almost 40% 198889. Out of the total revenue of $240,500 earned in that period, $96,000 was allocated for local development (Balakrishnan & Ndhlovu, 1992). A number of the local people had also found employment as village scouts and also with wildlife related activities, such as culling operations, safari hunting and tourism.
3.1.2. Income from hunting
In the past hunters in Africa hunted for the family pot. Today most hunters are market hunters and a high proportion of hunters would choose to sell their quarry and purchase cheaper forms of protein such as fish to feed their families, so that the money left over can be used for other basic family needs. Hunting occurs openly in countries where there are no strict legal prohibitions on wildlife exploitation. In countries with restrictions, hunting continues under cover and there are no statistics on hunters or on quantities of meat exploited. Data on total number of hunters in most African countries are either non-existent or out of date. A total of 26,770 hunters were reported in Nigeria in 1963 (Afolayan, 1980). There are very few people in Africa today whose occupation is solely hunting; most hunters work full-time on other jobs e.g., farmers, artisans, and only hunt on part-time basis.
The Kola Pygmies of southern Cameroon provide an example of total dependence on wildlife for cash income. The Pygmies' main occupation is hunting and they obtained as much income from the sale of their quarry as cocoa farmers in the area. The money derived from hunting was used to procure food, alcoholic beverages and manufactured items. The Kolas would also exchange bushmeat for carbohydrate food from their neighbours (Wilkie 1989; Garine, 1993). While this exchange was often at a disadvantage to the hunters (e.g., in the study in Cameroon, a giant rat Cricetomys gambianus which could be sold for 300 CFA was exchanged for four sticks of cassava pudding worth 100 CFA) it does have the advantage of avoiding the effects of inflation (see for example, studies on the Mbuti of Zaire. Ichikawa 1991).
Infield (1988) found hunting to be the single most important source of cash income for the majority of households in villages around the Korup National Park, Cameroon. The average hunter hunting for 16 days in a month earned approximately 350,000 CFA per annum, a figure which accounted for 38 % of the total village income. Income from trapping was estimated at 75,000 CFA and this accounted for about 18 % of the total village income.
A survey of farmers' hunting activities during 27 days of recording (7th January to 3rd February, 1976) in Sunyani in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, showed that 80 farmers sold 2,840 kg of their catch from hunting for ¢3,849.40 Cedis*. This gave an average daily income from part time hunting of ¢1.78 which was comparable to the daily government wage of ¢2.00 at that time (Asibey, 1977). Hunting continues to be a profitable occupation in Ghana and lucrative bushmeat markets exist in most major cities in the country. In a recent study on the economics of living with wildlife in Ghana, hunters supplying meat to the Atwemonom market in Kumasi, Ashanti region, were interviewed for information on their activities. All the hunters interviewed indicated that they were part-time hunters and their main occupation was farming, driving or artisanal. The hunters spent from a few hours daily to up to 11 hrs at week-ends hunting, they operated individually, hunting with guns or trapping
with snares. The direct costs of each hunt were the price of the shot gun (often owned by someone else who shared the hunting proceeds with the hunter), the cost of ammunition (180-200 Cedis** per cartridge), the cost of a hunting lamp and the cost of a game licence (This varied with the type of animal hunted, ranging from ¢300.00 for a grasscutter to ¢12,000.00 for large game). Animals commonly caught were Maxwell duiker, bushbuck, black duiker, royal antelope and grasscutter and the average income from hunting was 9,850 Cedis per week (Table 3.3). This figure was up to 40% more than the salaries of government employees in grades equivalent to the full time jobs of the hunters interviewed. Apart from the direct income derived from bushmeat by hunters, hunting also provides employment and income to a network of people including helpers. carriers and a chain of traders.

3.1.3 Bushmeat trade
Wild animals hunted may be consumed, sold locally or transported to urban markets where they fetch higher prices. Factors which determine which species are sold or consumed include the size of the animal, cultural inhibitions as well as personal or public appeal and demand. Table 3.4 gives the proportion of animal groups sold or consumed in a study of hunters' quarry in northeastern Gabon (Lahm, 1993). Rodents and other small-sized mammals were more likely to be consumed locally while the more appealing and profitable game were sold. Similar practices have been reported in Zaire where 77.5 % of ungulates killed by hunters were sold whereas 55.1 % rodents and 57.1 % of primates were eaten .n villages (Colyn et al., 1987).
The general trend in the past was for smaller species to be consumed locally while larger animals were sold. This trend however, is changing as a result of a combination of factors including increased demand, scarcity and the need for cash. Hence, species like pangolins, reptiles and rodents which were in the past consumed by the hunters' households or even only by children now find their way into the market.

Apart from countries such as Kenya and South Africa where game hunting is strictly controlled, bushmeat markets exist in many urban and rural markets throughout Africa. Bushmeat marketing is particularly well developed in West Africa and it is also the area where the trade has been well documented (see e.g. Asibey, 1977; Jeffery, 1977; Martin, 1983; Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1987). Bushmeat is an expensive meat throughout the region and in many areas it is more expensive than meat of domestic animals.
A number of bushmeat market centres in Ghana, notably the Kantamanto market in Accra and the Atwemonom market in Kumasi, have been studied for varying periods since the 1970's (see e.g. Asibey, 1977, Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1987, Falconer, 1992; Tutu et al., 1993). In Kumasi Ghana, a well organised bushmeat trade provides the main source of income to a chain of bushmeat traders (mainly women) involving wholesalers and retailers (Falconer, 1992; Tutu e' al. 1993). The bushmeat trade at the Atwemonom market is highly organised as small family businesses passed on from one generation to the next and fourth generation traders, i.e., traders whose mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers had been bushmeat traders can be found (see Box 7). The name "Atwomonom" (Atwe = plural for duiker; mono = fresh) means a place for fresh duiker meat in the Akan language.
Between 1971 and 1986, a yearly average of 68,797 kg (range 19,750 to 105,003 kg) of fresh bushmeat carcasses from 10-25 different wild animal species was recorded in the Kantamanto market (Table 3.5). More recent data on volume of fresh and smoked bushmeat coming into bushmeat markets in Kumasi are given in Table 3.6. A total of 13,884.6 kg of bushmeat valued at ¢9,251,759* were recorded over a 27-day period in 1991. This comprised of 3.6,32 animal carcasses belonging to 31 species. The total weights recorded in all cases were reported to be minimal because either; a) the recorders were not at the market on all days or throughout any particular day; b) often, some traders refused to allow records to be taken on their animals, or c) weights of some of the smoked meat recorded were not available.

Box 7 BUSHMEAT TRADE IN ATWEMONOM MARKET, KUMASI, GHANA
Kumasi has three main bushmeat market centres, Atwemonom, Kejetia and Central market. The Atwemonom market has a very well organised bushmeat trade and was the main outlet for fresh bushmeat in Kumasi while most of the smoked bushmeat came to the Central market. 100-150 animal carcasses are processed at the Atwemonom market each day of the open season (the period 1st August to 1st December is close season for exploitation of most wild animal species in Ghana). The Bushmeat trade in this market has been monitored for varying periods of time since the 1970s. The trade is dominated by women, both the wholesalers who were supplied directly by the hunters and the retailers who purchased from the wholesalers for retail to consumers were mostly women. The few men encountered in the trade were chop bar operators who also bought their meat from the wholesalers. In contrast, l all the hunters who supplied the meat to the market were men.
The women wholesalers controlled both the hunters' prices and the retails prices. Each wholesaler had a group of hunters who supplied her with meat regularly. The women often pre-financed the hunters who were then obliged to repay with meat and also provided credit facilities to the retailers. Through this system, the wholesaler was assured of regular supplies and market for her meat.
The hunters or their emissaries normally brought the carcasses to the women wholesalers at the market but in the past when communal hunting was legal and common, the women would follow the hunters on week-end communal hunting expeditions to purchase the quarry in the bush. If a hunter brought meat to the market, the cost of transportation was borne by the wholesaler. The carcasses were then sold whole to the retailers and chop bar operators, who then paid for the dressing and then cut them up into small pieces for retailing/cooking. Occasionally, individuals were allowed to purchase smaller animals, e.g. size of maxwell duiker and below, direct from the wholesaler for home consumption? but normally theft channel would be from the hunter to the wholesaler to the retailer before the consumer. Any carcasses which were not bought on any day were frozen to be sold the next day or smoked to be sold to smoked bushmeat traders at the Central market.
One aspect of the bushmeat trade which was dominated by men was the dressing of the meat. At Atwemonom market, all the carcasses purchased were dressed at a central point by a group of men who specialised in that job. Dressing involved removal of the pelage (normally by burning), cleaning and removal of the entrails. The fee charged for dressing of the carcasses varied according to the species and whether it was purchased by a regular retailer or an individual for home consumption and ranged from 400-800 Cedis for a Bushbuck; 200-500 Cedis for a Black duiker and 200 Cedis for Maxwell duiker, grasscutter brush tailed porcupine and other small animals in 1993. Carcasses purchased by individuals attracted 100-200 Cedis extra for dressing.
The Kumasi bushmeat trade illustrates the multiplier effect of income from hunting and employment from wildlife-based industries. The business was handed down from generation to generation and two or three generations of bushmeat traders were common. The trade provided the main source of livelihood for the traders and their families and several of the traders operated as family groups with one woman as the head, assisted by her children and grand children.
In 1993, an attempt was made to obtain a more complete picture of the volume of bushmeat trade passing through the Kantamanto market and the Atwemonom markets. Observers were stationed at the markets from dawn to dusk every day over a one week period in March and May to record the species, weights, purchase and retail prices of every animal coming to the markets. A total of 1276 carcasses weighing approx. 9,470 kg were recorded at the Kantamanto (742) and the Atwemonom (534) markets. These were purchased from the hunters at a total price of ¢3,177,164.00 and ¢2,891,250.00 at the two markets respectively (Tables 3.7 and 3.8). Analysis of the data showed that the profit margin of the Kumasi bushmeat traders ranged from 30 to 250% depending on the species and size of animal involved (Fig. 4).
Excluding the close season period (1st August to 1st December) when exploitation of most species is prohibited and therefore sale is done under cover, the figures recorded during the one week period in 1993 translates to an annual minimal production of 331,261 kg of bushmeat valued at ¢212,394,490 passing through the two markets alone. A comparison of the volume, weights and prices of the common animals coming into Kantamanto market in 1974, 1985 and 1993 showed that:
o species composition and volume of individual species marketed varied from year to year;
o the price per head of all species had increased several times fold;
o there was no indication of decreases in the sizes of animals being hunted;
o there had been very little change in the overall level of exploitation.
This would suggest that although the populations of most wild animal species are believed to be declining in the West African sub-region, hunters continue to put sufficient effort into hunting to maintain supply levels and satisfy the ever growing demand for bushmeat.

3.1.4 Trophies, skins & hides
Apart from bushmeat wild animals contribute to local economies through their by-products such as skins, hides, bones, shells and horns, but accurate information on income accruing to local communities from the marketing of such products is not available for any African country. Some wild animal species may be more valuable for their trophy (e.g. elephants, rhinos) or for their skins (e.g. carnivores, reptiles). Some of these items e.g., ivory and rhino horn have intrinsic value and people will continue to choose such items and pay high prices for ornaments made from these even when there are substitutes. The value of ivory rose from $5 per kg in the 1960s to $ 70 in the mid-1970s and further to $150 in early 1980s (UNEP, 1989). With this high increase in price, ivory became a form of currency by which rich businessmen exported money out of Africa. The drastic decline in elephant populations has been attributed mainly to poaching and illegal ivory trade. Until the ban on
international trade in African ivory, the bulk of ivory from the continent was supplied by Zaire, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sudan, Congo and South Africa.
Hides and skins may be used locally for the manufacture of items of clothing such as shoes, bags, belts and hats or may be transported for sale in city markets or exported for the manufacture of more sophisticated leather products. Ostrich and crocodile skins are valuable commodities used for the production of fancy and high quality leather goods. The skin of other reptiles such as pythons and lizards are also in great demand. Local craftsmen use bones and horns of wild animals for the manufacture of various artifacts which are sold to supplement household income.
3.1.5 Live animal trade
Demand for live wild animals comes from the pet industry, Zoological gardens, and biomedical research programmes. Various species of birds including parrots, tauracos arid finches as well as reptiles and monkeys are sold for pets locally or on the export market. Data exists in several African countries on wild animal exports because of the permits required for export. These data are, however, underestimates since they cover only those animals exported legally. Records of wild animal exports from Ghana between 1989-1994 show that reptiles form the bulk of the export trade with the Royal python topping the list, followed by the Bosc's monitor lizard, Tortoises and Agama lizards (Table 3.9). The total number of animals exported and value varied from year to year, averaging 50,500 specimens valued around US$140,000. Compared with the wild animal export records for earlier years, the volume of exports have gone down considerably over the past ten years. This is attributed to the
national ban on exploitation of African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus) which was instituted in 1986. Prior to the ban, Grey parrots accounted for the greater part of live wild animal exports from the country e.g. in 1985, 9,580 African Grey Parrots were exported at a value of US $ 287,400, accounting for nearly 46 % of the total number of animals exported and 84 % of the total revenue from the exports (Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1987). There is some evidence that the live animal trade is lucrative but that most of the profits go to the middlemen and international sales agents with very little going to the local people who do the capturing.
3.2 Wildlife and health
3.2.1 Spiritual health
3.2.2 Physical and mental health
Given that food is available, the ability for a person to gain access to food and consume it for the body to metabolise and assimilate it for use in the various physiological processes depend on the person's state of health, be it spiritual, mental or physical. The role of wild animals and wild animal products to health in Africa is therefore an important component in the matrix of issues pertaining to household food security on the continent. Apart from the direct contribution of wild resources to nutritional well-being, the successful use of traditional medicines reduces expenditure on medical care and saves the family money which can be used to purchase food and other necessities.
<section>b</section>
3.2.1 Spiritual health
In terms of spiritual health, many wild animals have spiritual and cultural association in Africa (see e.g., de Vos 1978, Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1987; 1992; 1995; Sanagho, 1991; Adeola 1992). Such animals may be regarded as sacred and accorded special respect or regarded with fear and may not be touched or killed because of religious or cultural dicta. Wild animals with spiritual and cultural uses fall into three main categories (Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1995):
Totem species: animals/plants regarded as symbols of an existing, intimate, unseen relationship; accorded respect and considered sacred. These may not be killed or eaten.
Tabooed species: a) animals regarded as sacred or holy because of some protection, guidance or help accorded to the ancestors through association with the species; and b) animals regarded as unclean and abhorred because of some misfortune in the past associated with the species. In both cases, eating, killing or even touching of such animals may be forbidden. Among the Akans in Ghana, the tradition is inherited through the male line i.e., a father passes it on to his children.

Sacrificial and/or ceremonial species: animals used in specific cultural rites and festivals, either in the rituals or in the preparation of the special dishes that go with such ceremonies.
Wild animals with spiritual or cultural associations in Ghana include the Leopard (totem of the Bretuo clan of the Akans),Buffalo (totem of the Ekoona clan); African Grey Parrot (totem of the Agona clan); Pied Crow (totem of the Asona clan). In many cases, the belief in the association is so strong that the psychological effects on an individual who breaks any of the taboos and is unable to fulfil the purification/pacification rites dictated can become manifested in mental or physical illness.

3.2.2 Physical and mental health
Health care is one of the most important issues and major problems pertaining to the quality of life in Africa today. Hospital facilities are nowhere adequate and a considerable number of people living in rural areas in Africa rely on traditional medicines for health care. The basis for traditional medicines and the primary ingredients used by the traditional healers are wild animal and plant species. The practice is widespread in Africa and market stalls selling plants and animal parts for medicines are common in both rural and urban markets in many African towns and cities. A large number of wild animal species and their products, used alone or with herbs, form the basis of the medicines used by traditional healers. Animal parts used include the meat, hair, skin, tail, bones, teeth, fat, glands and faecal pellets and the ailments treated range widely from mental and physical illnesses to antenatal care.
The list of wild animals believed to have medicinal and curative properties is long. Maliehe (1993) list the scrub hare Lepus saxatilis; cape hare L. capensis, porcupine Hystrix africae australis, the polecat Ictonyx striatus and the pangolin Manis temminckii as animals whose body parts are used in traditional medicine in South Africa. The pangolin is considered to be a particularly potent medicine by the Lobedu tribe in north-eastern Transvaal. Adeola (1992) recorded 23 species of wild animals including 16 mammals, six reptiles and a bird used for healing and preventive medicine in Nigeria (Table 3.10). Another 34 species were used in fertility treatments and 33 species were used in potency and aphrodisiac medicines. Whole animals or parts and faecal droppings of 26 species of wild animals were used in traditional medicines among communities living around forest national parks in Ghana (Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1992; Table 3.11).
A single species or specific parts of a particular species may be purported to have curative powers for several diseases e.g. the fat extracted from the Python and the Manatee is used to cure rheumatism, boils and back-ache while oils from the Leatherback turtle is used in the treatment of stroke, fevers, general body pains, skin diseases and constipation; and elephant dung is reported to be used for the treatment of at least five different ailments. In the case of a species such as the African giant snail, all parts of the body including the shell, the flesh and body fluids are used in the treatment of a whole range of ailments including hypertension, anaemia and convulsions in children. (Table 3.12).

Traditional medicine is based on years of experience gained from practice and indigenous knowledge passed on from one generation to the other. The actual proportion of the population in Africa which depends on this form of health care is unknown and attempts have not been made to quantify the value and benefits of wildlife/wildlife products as medicines in monetary terms. The popularity of traditional healers and traditional medicine may be attributed to a number of reasons including:
a) confidence in the system: the belief in traditional medicine is still very strong in rural areas in Africa and some people believe that such medicines are better and more potent for certain types of ailments than modern medicine.
b) financial limitations: the cost of both the healers and the medicines are far cheaper than modern medical facilities' in many cases, the curative powers of certain wild species is common knowledge and self-medication is practiced regularly.
c) accessibility: traditional healers are easily accessible and often available in remote areas where hospital facilities are no where close by. In Zimbabwe it is estimated that the ratio of traditional healers to the population is 1:234 in the urban areas and 1:956 in rural areas. The estimated proportions for the continent as a whole is 1:200 as compared with 1 :100,000 for western trained medical doctors (Makombe, 1994)
The effectiveness of most of the medicines from wild animals/wild animal parts has not been scientifically studied and proven and their potency in many cases may be questionable. In some cases, it is easy to comprehend why people would believe in the curative powers of certain preparations e.g., the use of faecal pellets of herbivorous animals which feed on plant species that are known to have medicinal properties. In other cases (e.g. the spiritual powers and vigour associated with the bones of many species of carnivores and the chameleon), it is difficult to find a scientific basis for such beliefs. This, however, could be linked to the myth and awe that surround such animals in rural Africa e.g., the lion is associated with strength and ferocity while the chameleon's ability to change colours is attributed to some magical powers. What is important, however, is that those who use traditional medicines out of preference or out of necessity believe in their effectiveness and
will continue to use them for a long time to come. By relying on these cheaper/free forms of medicines, the money which would otherwise be spent on medical bills becomes available for purchase of food or other essential household items. The strong belief in traditional medicines based on wild animals provides an incentive for the conservation and/or increased production of the species involved.
Some wild animal species, e.g. primates also contribute to health care through their use in the big-medical research. Gorillas were heavily exploited in some parts of Africa to obtain specimens for research centres in the west and also for zoological gardens (see e.g. Pi, 1981). Some wild animals provide valuable products for the development of modern drugs. Snake venom is in much demand for its therapeutic properties: the two types of venom, haematoxin and neurotoxin are used in treatments for haemophilia and in sedatives and pain killers.

3.3 Wildlife and forestry/agriculture
Wild animals exert significant influences on food production systems which may be positive or negative. Positive influences include the role of wild animals as seed dispersal and pollination agents as well as use of wild animal droppings as fertilisers. Many species of birds and mammals such as bats, monkeys, baboons and squirrels are known to spread fruit trees by their feeding action. A study in the Cote d'Ivoire found that sites where elephants had vanished long ago lacked saplings of certain tree species which are known to be dispersed by elephants (Alexandra, 1978)
On the negative side, some wild animals species are known as reservoir or intermediate hosts for parasites and disease pathogens which can be transmitted to man and his domestic stocks. Other wild animal species including both vertebrate and invertebrate species cause destruction to food and cash crops both during crop development and post-harvest storage. Vertebrate damage involves a wide range of wild animal species and a variety of crops (Table 3.13). The activities of the pest may result in direct crop losses, i.e. actual destruction of the food by the feeding of the pest and contamination or indirect losses which may occur through damage to production systems and equipment. Major vertebrate pests causing crop damage in Africa include a wide range of rodents and birds (see e.g., Ward? 1979; Elliot, 1979; Taylor, 1984; Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1988; 1989 (a); (b); Elias, 1988).
Birds, sometimes numbering in millions, can cause serious damage to grain fields. Species of birds causing damage to agricultural crops in Africa include weaver birds (Ploceidae), waterfowl (Anatidae), Parrots (Psittacidae) and seed eaters (Fringillidae), and crops frequently attacked include rice, maize, sorghum and oil palm. The main losses result from feeding of the birds on maturing crops, but losses at storage sites can also occur through feeding activity of the birds and contamination by roosting birds. The red-billed quelea Quelea quelea is the most important granivorous bird pest in Africa. The range of the species extends over 20% of the land area of the continent and affects the food production capacity of some 25 countries.
Estimates of annual losses of cereals to the red-billed quelea range from at least $1 million in Somalia to $ 6.3 million in the Sudan (Elias, 1988). Other weaver birds which often cause seasonally localised but serious damage to grains include the red-headed quelea, Quelea erythrops, the red bishop Euplectes orix and the yellow crowned bishop E afra Ntiamoa-Baidu (1989) reports destruction of whole rice fields, mainly by these three species in northern Ghana. Once the birds arrive in a good feeding area, their numbers can build up very quickly to several thousands and whole fields can be rapidly destroyed within a very short time. The population of birds at one roost monitored in the northern Ghana study increased from a total of 85,000 at the end of April when the birds started arriving in the area to over 400,000 within one month.

Crops destroyed by rodents include rice, maize, sorghum, millet, wheat, cocoa, oil palms and coconut. Sugar cane is particularly susceptible to rodent damage. The gnawing of the rodents opens the rind and the subsequent fermentation reduces the sugar content so dramatically that often the entire stalk is rendered useless. Rodent damage is not limited to field crops as considerable damage is also caused to stored products.
A wide range of other mammalian animal species including bats, baboons, monkeys and elephants can also cause significant damage locally to food crops such as plantains, bananas, cocoyam as well as cocoa and oil palm plantations. Bell (1984) reports that in the Lilongwe area of Malawi, crop damage was mainly caused by elephants, bush-pigs, baboons, vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops, eland Taurotragus oryx and Kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros, with elephants and bush-pigs accounting for 80% of the total damage. In Zambia, the main wild animal pests were bush-pigs, monkeys, baboons, elephants, hippopotamus and porcupine Hystrix cristata (Table 3.14)

Chapter 4. - Wildlife production systems: potentials for food security
4.1 . Wildlife production
4.2. Harvesting of wildlife
Supplies of bushmeat and other wild animal products on the African continent are derived from four main sources: wild sources, game ranching, game farming and wildlife domestication.
Production from the wild: comprises protected stocks in reserved lands and stocks in unprotected areas. Depending on the population densities and prevailing ecological and political conditions; stocks in protected areas may be culled for consumptive use, while stocks in lands outside protected areas are basically communal property, where there may be little or no control on exploitation, or control may be exercised at the local level either under governmental authority or traditional institutions.
Game ranching: comprises the maintenance of wild animals in defined areas delineated by fences. It is a form of husbandry similar to cattle ranching, the animals are managed on natural vegetation although the habitat may be manipulated to improve production efficiency. The animals on the ranch are the property of the ranch owner for as long as they remain on his ranch. Animals on ranches may be exploited for meat but most ranches aim for the added value of sport/trophy hunting, live animal sales and ecotourism.
Game farming: involves the confinement of wild animal species in a semi-domestic state where they are fed and grown to required weights and exploited for consumptive use. The criteria for selecting species for farming include ease of capture, adaptability to domestic conditions. ability to produce marketable meat and/or other desired products within reasonable time. According to Eltrigham (1984), wild animal species that are farmed are no longer truly wild and represent an intermediate stage between wild and domesticated species. Common animals currently farmed include the ostrich, crocodile and various duiker species.
Wild animal domestication: by definition domestication refers to the process which results in genetic adaptation of wild animals to the extent that the animal breeds readily in captivity and its owner has some control over its reproduction. (Eltrigham, 1984; Hudson et al., 1989). The process results in detectable differences between the domestic species and their wild progenitors. By this definition, the fact that a wild animal species is tamed or is raised like conventional livestock does not make the animal domesticated although the process might eventually lead to domestication.

4.1.1. Production from wild sources
National parks, game and forest reserves, unprotected forests and savannah lands, including secondary forests and farmlands, account for the greater proportion of bushmeat production on the African continent. Secondary forests and disused farms are particularly important as sources of rodents and duikers which account for most of the bushmeat eaten in rural Africa.
Data on wild animal populations and total biomass of stocks within African forests and savannah lands are scanty and available for only a few taxa in a limited numbers of sites. Biomass of large, medium and small herbivores in selected wildlife protected areas has been compiled by East (1984) who also related these to rainfall and soil nutrient status (Table 4.1). The figures ranged from a maximum standing stock of 19,663 kg/km^2 at Lake Manyara to a minimum of 54kg/km^2 in the Namib for large herbivores. In southern and eastern Africa, the herbivore biomass was dominated by arid savannah species. This group, which included species such as the savannah elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, zebra and wildebeest, accounted for over 90% of the total biomass in the arid/eutrophic savannas. Arid savannah species' mainly elephant and buffalo, also dominated the moist/dystrophic savannas, where the group accounted for 80% of the total herbivore biomass. Within the west African
sub-region, moist and arid savannah species accounted for about half the total biomass.
Biomass of wild animals have been estimated for only a few areas e.g., Prins & Reitsma (1989) report an estimated mammalian biomass of 1,050 kg km^2 in an unprotected lowland forest in south-western Gabon; while Oates et al (1990) estimate live biomass of non-human primates to be 2,300-3,600 kg km^2 in Kibale, Uganda; 1,230-1,530 kg km^2 in Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone and only 409 kg km^2 in the Doala-Edea in Cameroon. In comparison, Thomas (1991) estimate primate biomass in the Iture forest in Zaire to be 715 kg km^2 while that of the Tai National Park in Côte d'Ivoire is reported to be 1,010 kg km^2 (Bourlière, 1985). The biomass of primates reported for the various forests are considerably higher than that of species such as the forest elephant and large forest ungulates such as the buffalo. bongo and okapi, whose available biomass are estimated to be around 500 kg km^2 (Hladik et al., 1993).

Based on the estimated mammalian biomass of 1,050 kg km^2 in the forests of south-western Gabon, Feer (1993) estimated a total maximum sustainable yield (i.e., the proportion which can be safely taken off by subsistence hunting without jeopardising the resource base) of 70200 kg/km^2/year, representing some 7-20 % of the total estimated biomass. In addition to the vertebrates insects also contribute substantially to wild animal protein production in some parts of Africa during specific seasons and attempts have been made to estimate the biomass of insects that can be harvested from the forest. Hladik et al., (1993) estimated the dry weight of insects available for harvest on Barro Colorado, Panama to be 38-70 kg/ha/year. Their calculations were based on total leaf consumption and the assumption that it takes 10 kg of feed to make 1 kg of meat. The proportion of the total insect production that would be suitable for human consumption, is however unknown since a large number
of leaf-eating insects are not edible; species commonly collected and eaten in Africa include termites. caterpillars and larvae of several species of Coleoptera.
Estimates of forest cover and extent of protected area systems in Africa provide some idea of the extent of habitat available to wild animals on the continent. According to statistics provided by FAO, Africa has the second largest forest cover within the tropics, with an estimated total coverage of 528 million ha, accounting for 30% of the pan-tropical forest (FAO, 1993). McNeely et al., (1994) estimate that 240 million ha of land in sub-Saharan African is designated as protected areas (Table 4.2). This figure, which accounts for approximately 10% of the total land area on the continent, is based on wildlife protected areas but also includes forest reserves with nature protection functions.
In most African countries it illegal to hunt in protected areas and in some countries hunting of all large mammals is prohibited. It is however clear that the source of a significant proportion of the bushmeat production on the continent can be traced to protected and reserved lands either directly through illegal subsistence hunting, or indirectly where protected areas serve as reservoirs from which stocks in adjoining lands are replenished. All around Africa several innovative projects are showing that given adequate resources wildlife production can be a viable form of land use. These developments are helping to change the earlier thinking and approaches to wildlife conservation on the African continent which was largely based on strict preservationist strategies where all forms of consumptive use were considered undesirable and subsistence hunters were regarded as poachers and strictly dealt with when caught.
Most wildlife managers now admit that "conservation in a vacuum" has no future and recognise the need to replace that approach with a strategy that seeks to involve local people and integrate their needs into the management of wildlife resources. Protected area management approaches that pursue externally enforced exclusion of local people are crumbling under the pressures of illegal hunting and encroachment by crop farms. The current trend is towards evolving ways in which wildlife management schemes can provide concrete benefits in terms of food and income to local people who live with the wildlife and have to bear the cost of living with wildlife. In areas where wild animal populations densities are high and can sustain a measure of exploitation, questions are beginning to be asked about the feasibility of incorporating subsistence hunting by local hunters into the management equation.
Several examples can be found in Africa of projects that seek to integrate wildlife conservation with rural development; projects which aim to provide food security by generating food and income from wildlife for rural communities, but at the same time reduce pressure and encroachment on core protected areas. The Luangwa Integrated Rural Development Project in Zambia. and Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) are two projects which seek to provide benefits from wildlife to local communities.
The CAMPFIRE programme encourages wildlife production on marginal non-arable lands and empowers local people living under traditional land tenure systems on these lands to have responsibility for sustainable management and utilisation of the wildlife. The results of the CAMPFIRE show that wildlife protection/production is a viable form of land-use which can generate substantial income and food to local communities (see Box 8). The programme also demonstrates clearly that local support for wildlife conservation depends on whether or not the people identify themselves with conservation projects and whether or not such projects yield concrete benefits to the people. Benefits from the project include meat as well as cash income.

Box 8 ZIMBABWE'S CAMPFIRE PROGRAMME
"For those with eyes to see and ears to hear, Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE experiment holds many lessons" (Martin 1994). Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) was first established in two districts, Nyaminyami and Guruve in 1989. According to Zimbabwean laws wildlife is res nullius i.e. it belongs to no one (Martin 1994). Significant numbers of wild animals occur in national parks, state owned forests and reserves, but also on private lands and communal lands. In 1975, the Zimbabwean Parks and Wildlife Act gave control over wildlife on private lands and right to benefit from wildlife resources to the landowners. This meant that a land owners did not own the wildlife but had the right to manage and benefit from the wildlife as long as they remained on his land. Local people living on communal lands, however, had no such privileges; their wildlife was managed by the government. This situation changed after independence when the act was
amended to permit district councils to manage and benefit from their wildlife.
For years the attitude of most local Zimbabweans towards wild animals was, understandably, antagonistic. Poaching was a persistent problem in national parks, state vests and reserves as people living around protected areas killed wildlife to supplement income or to feed their families. CAMPFIRE is a programme which empowers local people living on marginal non-arable lands under traditional land tenure to have control over and derive benefits from their wildlife resources. The principle underlying the programme is that rural communities who suffer the costs of living with wildlife should benefit accordingly. It places custodianship of the wildlife resources and responsibility for sustainable management and utilisation on the local people themselves. Governmental control over use of the wildlife resources involve the establishment of the quotas of different animal species that can be taken while ensuring sustainability. The benefits from CAMPFIRE have now changed local
attitudes towards wildlife: people now want more wildlife on their lands and poaching pressures on protected areas has decreased considerably.
In 1993, twelve districts with a total population of 400,000 earned US$ 1,516,693 in trophy fees and received another $97,732 from tourism, culling and from problem animals that had to be shot. Estimates provided by WWF indicate that household income in communal areas has increased by 15-25% as a result of benefits from the CAMPFIRE programme. For example the Hurungwe District's population of 31,000 received $119,342 from CAMPFIRE activities in 1993, which increased to $ 145,519 in 1995. (Butler, 1995) .
The revenue generated by CAMPFIRE from sport hunting, tourism, sale of animals etc., goes directly to the communities and members decide on how it is spent. Some villages divide it equally among heads of households, some put it into community projects such as schools, clinics, corn mills etc., while others use part for projects and pay the rest out as household dividends. In addition to the revenue, households receive meat from culling operations. The success of the CAMPFIRE programme clearly illustrates that given adequate resources, wildlife production can be a viable form of land-use even on marginal lands.

4.1.2 Wildlife ranching
The feasibility and profitability of game ranching have been amply demonstrated by a number of studies. The rationale behind advocating game ranching in Africa is that conditions in many parts of' the continent, whether resulting from inadequate rainfall or presence of certain disease organisms' are not appropriate for production of exotic cattle and other domestic stocks. Indigenous wild animal species on the other hand have evolved in the African ecosystem and are better adapted to the prevailing conditions and should therefore be more productive.
Game ranching is currently most developed in southern Africa (particularly South Africa Namibia and Zimbabwe), although a private game ranch, the Galana Ranch, was established in Kenya in the 1970s (King and Heath, 1975; Thresher, 1980). The ranch initially focused on three species: the fringe eared oryx, Oryx beisa callotis, the African buffalo and the eland. Reported advantages of the eland over the Boran cattle included much lower water requirement, faster breeding and growth, earlier maturity and ability to put on weight in grazing conditions under which the Boran cattle began to lose weight and approximately 14 % higher dressing out weight. In addition to these biological and physiological advantages a cost-benefit analysis of maintaining a breeding herd of 11,000 oryx and 5000 Boran on the ranch showed clearly that the financial returns on the oryx was far superior to that of cattle (Thresher, 1980).
Luxmoore (1985) estimated that there were 7000-10,000 farmers in South Africa who derived some income from game ranching. Income from the wildlife on the ranches was derived from live animal sales, sport and trophy hunting and touristic use. Most land in South Africa is privately owned, fenced and has been used over long period for grazing domestic stock or for arable crops. By 1992, South Africa had 3,500 game ranches (Grossman et al., 1992); the network of private reserves and game ranches has grown from less than 2 million in 1979 to more than 16 million acres (Chadwick, 1996).
In other southern African countries such as Zimbabwe, more and more private farmers are converting their lands into wildlife ranches or incorporating wildlife on cattle ranches as mixed ranches while communal lands are increasingly being managed for wildlife. Campbell & Brigham (1993) classifies wildlife production into the small scale sector and the large scale sector (fig xx). Producers in the large scale sector include individual farmers, large companies, the Zimbabwean Forestry Commission and the Department of Parks and Wildlife Management. The small scale sector comprises production on communal lands. It is estimated that 22 % of the country is devoted wildlife production. Approximately 2.7 million hectares of this total (roughly 20%) is commercial farmland being managed for wildlife production (sometimes on mixed ranches with livestock).
Ghana's Shai Hills Game Production Reserve (recently re-named Shai Hills Resource Reserve) was one of the first attempts at game ranching within the west African sub-region. The project was first mooted in the early 1970s and the idea was to restock the heavily depleted wildlife resources of the 22 km^2 reserve with selected ungulates for meat production. The source of the animals for the re-stocking oscillated between capturing from other wildlife conservation areas in the country, particularly from Mole National Park, to bringing animals in from east Africa (Kenya). Although the feasibility studies undertaken for the project indicated that the project could be viable, it never took off but still remains on the books.
Burkina Faso's Nazinga Game Ranch (Box 9) has demonstrated that even in West Africa where wild animal populations are relatively low, game ranches are feasible and can be profitable. The 940 km² ranch is basically a protected area where wildlife is produced and harvested on a quota system. Local hunters are trained to do the cropping and the local communities benefit from the meat as well as the revenue from the other forms of usage, e.g., tourism and sport hunting that is allowed on the ranch.
A number of studies have been undertaken to document the comparative advantages of wild animal production in Africa in terms of their biological, ecological and physiological attributes, efficiency in utilising available vegetation, productivity and economic viability (see e.g. King and Heath, 1975; Surujbally, 1975; Thresher, 1980; Eltringham, 1984; Luxmoore, 1985; Muir, 1989; Bojo, 1995). The argument is that because wild animals have evolved in Africa over a very long period of time, they must be more highly adapted. physiologically and ecologically. to the natural environment than domestic stock brought in from elsewhere. Wildlife are also known to be better capable of converting vegetable matter into protein without causing deterioration of the habitat and under circumstance such as in country infested with tsetse flies wildlife provide a more appropriate means of making such land productive. A brief summary of the advantages of wild animals over cattle is presented
below (see also Box 9), but for a more comprehensive review, the reader is referred to Reul 1 979.
Fig. 5 Estimated land areas (km²) used for wildlife conservation and production in Zimbabwe in 1990 (Source Campbel & Brigham, 1993)
Reproduction: Most species of wild ungulates up to the size of eland and buffalo are characterized by a relatively high reproduction potential, rapid growth and early maturity as compared with cattle. Calving intervals for cattle range from 591-759 days in Africa and reproductive efficiency of 35-60% have been reported for the American tropics. In comparison, the females of most ungulates up to the size of oryx normally produce one young per year. The African buffalo has a reproductive efficiency of 75 % despite the fact that the gestation period of 11.5 months far exceeds that of cattle. First breeding varies from just under one year for smaller antelopes and gazelles to between one and two years of age for larger antelopes. First breeding age for eland and buffalo is between 3 and 4 years which is approximately the same as for cattle.
Box 9 THE NAZINGA GAME RANCH
Burkina Faso's Nazinga Game Ranch is a unique within within West African sub-region of a protected area which seeks to reconcile wildlife conservation with the needs of local people (Jachmanne Croes, 1991; Damiba and Ables, 1993; BSP, 1993). Situated in the south-central part of Burkina Faso and adjacent to the Ghana border, the Nazinga is currently the only functioning game ranch in the sub-region. The Nazinga Game Ranch was established in 1979 by the Burkina Faso government in collaboration with the African Wildlife Husbandry Development Association, a Canadian non-profit organisation. The ranch covers an area of 940 km² in tall-grass tree/shrub savanna country. The main objectives for establishing the Nazinga Game Ranch were:
o to ensure protection of wildlife threatened by poaching and agricultural encroachment
o to create jobs by integrating the local populations into management of the ranch.
o to provide animal protein for local people through cropping of wild game species.
The ranch is surrounded by thirteen villages. The main occupation of the local communities is subsistence farming, growing mainly millet Pennisetum typhoides, sorghum Sorghum bicolor, corn Zea mays, yams Dioscorea spp, groundnuts Arachis hypogea and a variety of legumes. Like most rural Africa n communities infrastructure in the villages is very rudimentary, e.g., water supply is limited to one or two wells; the nearest hospital is 55 km away and the people rely on the medical personnel land facilities provided by the ranch.
After serious initial conflicts with the local communities and heavy investment, the Nazinga Game Ranch has now become basically a protected area in which wild animals are harvested and which is able to cover its running costs from revenue generated from sale of meat and other animal products, sports hunting and tourism. Game meat is derived from the most abundant species on the ranch the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus as well as other ungulates such as the roan antelope Hippotragus equinus, oribi Ourebia ourebi, hartebeest Alcelaphus huselaphus, bushbuck Tragelaphus scripted, Grey duiker Silvicapria grimmia, buffalo Syncerus caffer and waterbuck Kobus defassa. Local hunters are trained to cull the larger game on a strict quota system about 5% of the population of each species. Local people also act as guides and helpers for sport hunters. Part of the revenue from sport hunting and tourism is paid to the local communities. The Nazinga Game Ranch has thus, brought benefits
to the local communities in terms of infrastructure, market opportunities anal temporary jobs. The success of the Nazinga Game Ranch clearly illustrates that with adequate investment and effective protection, animal populations within protected areas in the West African sub-region can increase to the levels that they can be cropped to supply the much needed animal protein to local communities? but also generate sufficient revenue from wildlife related activities to become self-sustaining.
Growth Rate: There is some evidence that wild animals reach marketable or economically harvestable size at an earlier age than domestic stock (Table 4.3). Studies in East Africa, report weight gains varying from 0.06 kg per day for Thompson gazelle to 0.33 kg per day for eland (de Vos, 1969) as compared with 0.14 kg per day for poorly managed cattle on similar conditions on the East African rangelands (Talbot et. al. 1962).

Physiological adaptations: a number of studies suggest that wildlife is better adapted in terms of water conservation and heat stress under semi-arid and arid areas; that they possess greater resistance to endemic diseases and yield a higher production than cattle in such areas. There is also evidence that wildlife utilises the vegetation better by using everything from the grass on the ground to the leaves on the trees and that they do not damage the habitat as quickly or as markedly as do domestic stock. Wild ungulates such as oryx, impala wildebeest and eland have specialized water conservation systems and require considerably less water than cattle under the same circumstances. According to Taylor & Lyman (1967) this is due to a high oxygen-extraction efficiency which implies a smaller loss of water in expired air, and a flexible thermo-regulation system. Some species have excellent renal and faecal water resorption and are able to survive on water obtained from plants
and shrubs without drinking water for long periods of time. This study also demonstrated that eland and oryx can tolerate a heat stress of 45° C without any problems. This degree of tolerance is attributed to their ability to permit their body temperature to rise, thereby avoiding the loss of water in thermo-regulation. Diurnal variations in body temperature of more than 10° C were recorded. These physiological adaptations are further enhanced by behavioural patterns such as resting in the shade and feeding at night on succulent leaves.
The practical implication of such water conservation abilities is that wild animals are less dependent upon free water for their survival and can utilise semi-arid and arid range more effectively than domestic stock which requires considerably more water. This also means that the wild ungulates are able to disperse over greater areas of land and thus the trampling, overgrazing and consequent land deterioration characteristic of areas around watering points of domestic animals like cattle is avoided. Under drought conditions, hundreds of thousands of cattle die. not because of lack of water alone but also because of starvation due to the heavy concentrations around the watering holes.
Resistance to disease: Wild animal diseases and the role of wild animals as reservoirs of disease pathogens affecting humans and domestic animals continue to be a controversial issue in animal husbandry which militates against the commercial utilisation of wild animals for meat production. Advocates for the use of wildlife for meat production argue that wildlife are immune to many stock diseases. For example wild animals are known to be more tolerant to diseases like trypanosomiasis to which cattle succumb easily. This makes wild animal production a more appropriate option in tsetse infested areas. Those who oppose the use of wild animals for meat production (understandably large scale cattle farmers) on the other hand claim that wildlife are disease carriers and should be exterminated from all areas where cattle are found. Unfortunately, information on wildlife disease relationships of is lacking in both quantity and quality and is sometimes conflicting in nature. Diseases
of cattle on the other hand have been studied in great detail over a long period of time.
Ecological: The physiological advantages of wild animals make them better adapted to the climatic and habitat conditions of African rangelands than cattle. Secondly, different wild animal species show varying feeding habits in terms of preferred food species and parts of plant food items selected. They are therefore able to utilise available vegetation better as compared to domestic stock which have a narrow spectrum of food selection patterns. The feeding habits of domestic animals often leads to inefficiency in the use of available vegetation and over-exploitation of specific components of the vegetation resulting in habitat degradation.
Productivity:
A number of studies have shown that under good management, off-take rates on wildlife ranches can be very high. For example, studies of Thomson's gazelle on Kekopey and Suguroid ranches in Kenya registered annual population growth rates of 60% and indicated a sustainable off-take of 40% except in very dry years (Blankenship et al., 1990). Game animals on the whole have much faster rates of growth than cattle. so that on a body weight conversion basis they would be more efficient meat producers. Allowing for the fact that small antelopes consume more food relative to body size, it is estimated that impala under a commercial ranching situation would still give a conversion efficiency 10-20% greater than cattle. Live weight production per unit area for the Thomson gazelle in Kenya was found to be 17% higher than that of cattle (Hopcraft and Arman, 1971). Feer (1993) analysed reproduction, growth and productivity of several wild species that are either already used or are
experimentally/potentially usable for intensive or semi-intensive rearing and compared this with figures for selected domestic species reared in the humid tropics (Table 4.4). The conclusion was that in terms of meat return, rodents like the grasscutter and the smaller antelopes were comparable to the domestic pig and far superior to cattle.
Meat yield: Wild ruminants are known to have higher nutritional efficiency than domesticated ruminants . The dressed weight of African game animals is found to be 50 to 63% of the live weight as compared with 44 to 50% in domestic stock (Talbot et. al., 1962). Studies at the Galana Ranch in Kenya reported carcass yield of 57% for oryx, 55% for eland and 52% for cattle. In terms of actual protein production, the value of game is even higher than that indicated by the carcass yield since cattle could have up to 40% fat content in dressed carcasses compared with 2.5% in wild ungulates. Thus on the whole, wild animals yield higher lean meat than domestic animals (Table 4.5).

Economic considerations: In an attempt to determine the relative profitability of cattle and wildlife in the arid regions of Zimbabwe, Jansen et al. (1992) estimated returns to investment and the comparative advantage of 89 cattle ranches, wildlife ranches and combined d cattle/wildlife ranches in 1989/90. Their analysis indicated that in general wildlife had higher economic returns than cattle. However the results varied (in terms of appropriateness of either wildlife' cattle or both as a land use systems) depending on the area. "Cattle only'' enterprises had an average 1.8% financial (private) return on investment, the return to cattle on ranches combining cattle and wildlife, was 2.6%. The weighted average return of came enterprises was Z$2.78 per ha. Only four out of the 77 ranches producing beef had a greater than 10% return on investment and only three cattle enterprises had returns greater than Z$25.00/ha. The speculative return on holding land was excluded from all
analyses. Thirty-nine percent of the cattle enterprises had a negative adjusted net revenue and to continue in operation most of the ranches were destocking or borrowing. Wildlife only ranches were the most financially viable with average returns on investment of 10.5% Over half of the wildlife enterprises had a greater than 10% return on investment and only 4 had negative adjusted net revenue. The weighted average return of wildlife enterprises was Z$5.8 per hectare. Recent studies of the wildlife industry in Zimbabwe (Martin, 1994) confirm the profitability of wildlife ventures and indicate that the net financial returns from land under wildlife significantly exceed what is possible from land under cattle (US$1.11 per ha. for wildlife as against US$0.60 for cattle). There are also indications that the potential for increasing revenue from wildlife (up to US$5 per ha for sport hunting and US$25 per ha for eco-tourism) is far greater than for cattle.
Based on computer models, Thresher (1981) compared the value of a maned lion as a resource on the Amboseli rangelands to cattle ranching and concluded that the value of the single lion to the national economy was equivalent to a base herd of 30,000 zebu cattle or 6.400 steers in a year. The reason that wildlife offers much higher potential returns than cattle lies in the fact that wildlife can be marketed for more than just the basic value of its meat, skin and other products. The value can be greatly enhanced through wildlife based industries such as tourism and sport hunting, even at much lower levels of stocking and utilisation

4.1.3. Wildlife farming and domestication
The idea of domesticating wild animal species for meat production to improve protein supply in Africa is not new. As far back as 1848, the domestication of the eland and buffalo was mooted in South Africa (Surujbally, 1975). However, despite these early intentions, the only African wild animal species which have been successfully domesticated completely are the ostrich and the camel. A number of species, e.g., the crocodile, are farmed on large scale under semi-domesticated conditions. Domestication of wild species has been particularly popular in the West African sub-region where bushmeat is a most important dietary item. Conservationists and advocates of wild animal domestication have argued for the farming of favourite species to increase bushmeat production and supply in the sub-region and also to reduce pressure on wild populations. Species advocated include the grasscutter (Cane rat). the giant rat Cricetomys gambianus, a number of duiker species, the guinea fowl
Numida meleagris and the giant African snail Achatina sp. and Archachatina sp. Pioneering work on domestication of the grasscutter was undertaken by the Game and Wildlife (now Wildlife Department) in Ghana in the 1970s, while the University of Ibadan, Nigeria concentrated on giant rats. Work on snails has been carried out in both Ghana and Nigeria for a long time e.g., a study on various aspects of biology and ecology of snails and captive rearing of snails has been going on in the Zoology Department of the University of Ghana for over 20 years.
While there is no doubt at all that domestication and farming of favourite wild animal species could provide viable complementary or alternative sources of animal protein the key to its acceptance on a wide scale depends on the development of technical know-how and cheap methods of production. It is obvious that rearing of wild species will only be widely embraced if production costs and efforts are lower than that of bushmeat obtained through hunting and the returns are comparable to what pertains in traditionally acceptable livestock ventures (e.g. chicken, goat, sheep and cattle).
Crocodile Farming
Unregulated hunting of crocodiles, mainly for their skins but also for meat, led to major declines in the populations of all the three species on the African continent and the introduction of trade controls under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of wild flora and fauna (CITES). In response to the need to satisfy the demand for crocodile products, crocodile farming ventures were initiated. Over the past two decades, FAO has provided direct assistance in crocodile farm management to several developing countries. Within Africa, crocodile farms were first started in Zimbabwe but have now spread to many parts of the continent, particularly Southern and Eastern African countries.
Crocodile eggs are collected from the wild and brought to the farms to be incubated and hatched, and the hatchlings are raised in captivity. In Zimbabwe, the farmers are required to return a proportion of hatchling to the wild. This has led to significant increases in the wild populations. Earnings from the industry have also grown significantly, from US $300,000 in 1980 to US $2.6m in 1989 (Muir, 1994). In 1991, over 58,000 eggs were collected from the wild, mostly from Lake Kariba, and the industry earned US $2m in hide sales (Makombe 1993). Crocodile farming, therefore, not only generates income for households, thereby increasing household purchasing power and food security, but also has direct conservation benefits.
Ostrich Farming
Ostriches are farmed in many areas in southern Africa for their skin which is used in making luxury, high fashion leather goods and also for their high quality low fat and low cholesterol red meat. In Zimbabwe, the birds are farmed intensively and earn substantial foreign currency (see Table 3.2). The birds are slaughtered at 14 months old when the skin has reached the desirable size of 120sq decimetres and after the first picking of the feathers (Conroy and Gaigher, 1982). In a few areas e.g., Zimbabwe, birds with pure wild blood are being re-stocked into areas where they occurred in the past.
Grasscutter domestication
The grasscutter (Cane-rat) is a hystricomorph rodent endemic to Africa. The animal occurs in savannah grasslands, forest clearings, cultivated lands and secondary forests, where it is very common and is heavily hunted as a food resource in many areas on the continent. Grasscutters are herbivorous, their favourite food being savannah grasses (Asibey, 1974b). In captivity, they will also take sugar cane, corn stalks and cassava peelings. The animal is a wasteful feeder, cutting the grass at a characteristic angle with its very powerful incisors to eat the more nutritious, succulent inter-nodes, leaving behind scattered pieces of stem on the feeding grounds. This characteristic feeding behaviour is exploited by hunters who look for the feeding sites, an indication of where the animals were active the previous night and concentrate hunting efforts in such areas. The animal does not burrow? but may shelter in hollows and burrows made by other animals. This means enclosures for
captive rearing can be fenced in by mud walls. The grasscutter has a long gestation period, about five months, a relatively small litter size, maximum of four in the wild but up to twelve has been recorded in captivity. The young are born with their eyes open and the coat fully developed and are able to follow the mother immediately after birth. Females can be re-fertilised after parturition if paired with the male, thus two litters are possible in a year. Average weight of wild grasscutters is 4 - 5kg, males can reach up to 10 kg. Captive grasscutters can be kept in cages or boxes but are best kept in open areas enclosed within mud walls or other fencing material where males and females can be kept together. Depending on the size of cages used, stocking rates of one male to five females are possible. Pregnant females must be separated at full term since cannibalism of males on the newly born young ones is common.
Within the West African sub-region, grasscutter is the favourite bushmeat species and accounts for the greater proportion of bushmeat sold in markets. In most of the countries within the sub-region, grasscutter meat fetches higher prices than that of beef. The popularity of grasscutter meat led to the choice of the animal as the subject of several studies during the early 1970s, aimed at domesticating the species for large scale farming and production of the meat for human consumption.
Ewer's studies in Ghana in the 1970s demonstrated that the animal could be kept in captivity (Asibey, pers. com.). Her work was followed by studies on several aspects of the biology and ecology of the animal in Ghana (Asibey, 1974b; Ntiamoa-Baidu, 1980) and in Nigeria (Ajayi, 1971). In addition to the field studies on feeding and reproductive ecology, Asibey also worked directly with farmers. Interested farmers were provided with a starting stock of a male and a female grasscutters (mostly captured from the wild) and a cage. The performance of the animals was monitored by trained extension workers. The idea was that the research findings could be applied directly by farmers and that both rural and urban households could rear grasscutters in their back-yard to provide meat to feed the family The studies confirmed the feasibility of rearing the grasscutter in captivity and demonstrated that its litter size could be increased with good feeding. However, the initial interest and
efforts put into the project did not result in the establishment of any large scale, grasscutter farms and only a few people continued with the idea of back-yard grasscutter farming. The waning support could be attributed mainly to the relatively large initial capital investment required, the lack of readily available breeding stock, problems of feed during the dry season and the many unresolved and poorly understood issues associated with diseases in captive grasscutters.
More recently, a major research programme on grasscutters has been initiated in Benin under the Project Benino - Allemand d'Aulacodiculture (PBAA). The aim of the project is to select improved grasscutter stocks genetically adapted to life in captivity and to promote the rearing of the animal in rural and sub-urban environments (Baptist and Mensah, 1986; Mensah, 1991). The research focused on the ethology of the animal, feed, pathology and reproduction as well as on the technical feasibility of farming grasscutters at the level of small scale farmers.
Feasibility reports on grasscutter farming ventures indicate that the long term profitability is comparable to that of poultry farming and higher than cattle ranching (Tutu e' al., 199(i). However, the high costs of initial inputs (cages. breeding stocks), the slow returns and the limited technical expertise has hampered the adoption of back-yard grasscutter farming by rural households and the development of large scale commercial ventures. The market for both fresh and smoked grasscutter meat is effectively unlimited and there is therefore the need to invest in research to develop cheaper ways of production and extension services to enable the transfer of appropriate technologies to small scale farmers.
Domestication of the Giant Rat
The giant rat is a nocturnal, burrowing rodent which is exploited for food in many rural areas in Africa. A programme to domesticate the giant rat was initiated at the Department of Forest Resources Management, University of Ibadan in the early l 1970s (Ajayi, 1971; 1975; Ajayi et al. 1978) with the aim of maximising meat production from the species. The reports from the studies indicate that giant rats adapt very quickly to captive conditions wild caught individuals settle within two months of capture and start to breed; and by the fourth generation, all evidence of agonistic behaviour characteristic of wild rats had disappeared. Caged animals soon became habituated to their cages and readily adopted new diets. While the studies amply demonstrated that giant rats could be kept easily in captivity, large scale rearing of the animal never materialized. This is attributed to the wide-spread superstitions and cultural aversion towards rats which makes the meat unacceptable to
many tribal groups within West Africa.
Snail Farming
Attempts at wild animal domestication have not been restricted to vertebrate species; invertebrate species including snails and caterpillars have also been the subject of domestication. The Romans farmed snails for decades (Elmslie, 1982). In Africa, the feasibility of farming the giant snail was demonstrated by a number of researchers in West Africa in the early 1970s (e.g. Ajayi, 1971; Plummer, 1975; Ajayi et al., 1978; Hodasi, 1979). Snails have been raised in small pens in many areas within the sub-region and currently in Ghana, there is a major campaign to promote snail farming both as a back-yard activity to supplement household income and protein supply and as large scale commercial activity.
The edible giant snails in African belong to two genera Achatina Lamarch and Archachatina Albers. Species of both genera are common south of the Sahara; Achatina achatina being the most common species in West Africa, while Archachatina marginata occurs more commonly in Southern Nigeria and in the Congo basin (Hodasi, 1984). The West African species prefers primary rain forest habitats but also occurs in moist secondary growth and in the undergrowth of cocoa and rubber plantations. Snail populations are highest during the rainy season when they are collected in large numbers by rural communities, Snails are marketed fresh or smoke-dried and can be very cheap during the season when they are abundant. Attitudes of people to snail consumption vary within the sub-region with three main tendencies. In the southern forest regions, snails are a delicacy for a large number of people and such people are prepared to pay high prices for them. In the northern areas, snails are a taboo
and many tribes will not touch them, let alone eat them. In between the two extremes, are those who would prefer other forms of animal protein, but who would take snails, particularly during the season of abundance when snails can be collected freely from the wild or purchased cheaply from the markets. It is the first category of people that snail farming ventures could target.
In the wild, snails actively grow and reproduce during the rainy season and estivate in the dry season. In captivity, they can grow and reproduce throughout the year if they are provided with regular supply of water, food and lime (Ajayi et al., 1978). In the wild, they are predominantly vegetarian, browsing on tender leaves, vegetables and fruits which have dropped to the ground. Captive snails have been fed on wild lettuce Lactuca taraxacifolia and a wide range of other leaves and ripe fruits including pawpaw. Ajayi et al. (1978) listed 28 species of dicotolydons and six species of monocotolydons eaten by A. marginata and reported mean incubation period (measured from onset of egg laying to hatching) of 38 days (range 30 - 45 days). Body weight at hatching averaged 2.14 gm with a weekly growth of 0.85 gm and adult weights of up to 230 gm were recorded. Young snails reach sexual maturity at approximately 7-8 months of age.
The snail farming industry is growing rapidly in West Africa, and with adequate support, both financial and technical, the industry has a high potential as a source of animal protein for both rural and urban households. Apart from being cheap, snails have the advantage of being easily transported and easy to store alive for a considerable length of time. The small unit size also means that producers for household consumption can harvest just what is required for a meal.

4.2.1 Game cropping and culling

4.2.3. Bushmeat processing and marketing
4.2.1 Game cropping and culling
Eltringam ( 1994) defines game cropping as the taking of a sustainable yield from a completely wild population. This definition implies regular harvest from a wild population. Cropping would have the objective of either wild animal population control or harvesting to provide bushmeat and other wild animal products for local consumption and/or for income generation. Culling, on the other hand, can be a one time activity with the primary objective of reducing animal populations. Provision of meat in this case becomes an ancilliary objective.
Culling of animals in conservation areas continues to be a controversial issue. While conservation scientists and protected area managers argue for its use as a management tool to control herbivore populations, extreme conservationists consider it morally wrong. Culling, as a game management tool has been used in some protected areas within southern and eastern Africa (see e.g. Hanks et al., 1981, Walker et al.. 1987) and has been undertaken for two reasons:
i) to prevent or reduce habitat degradation caused by high densities of herbivorous animals;
ii) as a species protection strategy e.g., in cases where there is competition between a locally abundant and a rare species, a proportion of the population of the abundant species may be culled to reduce the competition.
An additional very important reason for culling locally abundant species in Africa should be the need for animal protein, and the social injustice of allowing large numbers of common species to roam in and out of protected areas destroying habitat and crops when local people living around the protected areas are mar-nourished from protein deficiency.
Game cropping and culling operations are not restricted to state initiatives in protected areas but may also be a regular harvesting technique on game ranches and private lands. This is particularly common in countries such as South Africa where game animals have been kept on private lands for both conservation and sport hunting purposes for many years. Blankenship et al. (1990) provides a review of earlier attempts at game cropping within the eastern central and southern African sub-regions. While the game cropping ventures in eastern and central Africa have been initiated and sponsored mainly by governments. attempts in southern African have been primarily private enterprises.
During the 1960's the most intensive culling of large wild animals in tropical Africa, organised at government level, took place in Uganda. The aim was to reduce animal numbers in the Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls National Parks over a short period of time (Bindernagel, 1968). Approximately 12,000 hippopotami and 2,000 elephants were killed. The hippos were butchered and sold fresh in the field to traders who then retailed the meat outside the parks, while the elephant meat was smoked and sold in nearby villages and towns. The success of the Ugandan operation was due to several factors including: high densities of people (51.4 per square ha) financially able to purchase the meat in communities surrounding the parks so that there was no need for long distance transportation; the absence of domestic livestock and consequent shortage of meat in the area; the existence of good rural road system and the fact that the authorities imposed no rules about meat hygiene.
Experimental cropping of elephants and buffaloes were also undertaken in the Luangwa Valley in the 1960s by the Game Department of Zambia. The meat was smoked using traditional methods and offered at low prices to local people who were believed to be protein deficient. It appears, however that this assumption was totally wrong since the people were themselves successful subsistence hunters and their response to the offer was poor (Marks 1976). Up to a total of about 1,464 elephants, 1,353 hippos, and 237 buffaloes had been killed by 1972 when the cropping ceased. According to Blankenship et. al. (1990) the project was said to be an economic loss.
Government-regulated game cropping in Kenya began with the establishment of the Galana Game Management Scheme in 1960. The aim was to develop commercially viable and sustained game cropping scheme and at the same time provide employment for people living around protected areas. The scheme concentrated on the sale of elephant meat and ivory. Like the Zambian attempt, this scheme was also an economic loss and the government finally handed over to a private enterprise. During the 1970s other cropping experiments were undertaken in Kenya to develop techniques for game cropping and to investigate the potential market for game meat on the Kekopey Ranch and Suguroi Estate. Procedures had to comply with strict standards laid down by the Kenya Veterinary Department. A total of 1.320 Thomson's gazelle and 1,083 impala were cropped at both Kekopey and Suguroi. The skins and 35 tons of dressed carcasses obtained from the total of 2,358 antelope cropped were marketed for profit of KSh
65,292.00 (US $9,144.54) and the project was considered successful (Table 4.6). In 1989, there was only one cropping company in Kenya operating on three ranches and producing approximately 45 tons of meat per annum. The Kenya Wildlife Service estimated that demand for game meat would reach 500 tons per annum by the end of 1995 (Byrne et al., 1994).

The Kamwenje culling scheme provides a more recent example of a game cropping scheme with the primary objective of providing cheap game meat for local communities. The scheme was established in 1989 near Nsefu Upper Lupanda Game Management Area (ULGMA) of Zambia. Large mammals culled under the scheme included buffalo, bush-pig, hippopotamus, impala, warthog, wildebeest and zebra. Unfortunately, a survey of local people's perceptions of wildlife in the ULGMA area showed that although 81.5% of the respondents were aware of the scheme, only 18.5% had actually had the opportunity to purchase some of the meat sold under the scheme (Balakrishman and Ndholovu, 1992). Nearly half of the sample population had not purchased meat from the scheme because of lack of money, and as many as 88% of the few people who had purchased meat from the scheme rated the price as too high.

4.2.2 Subsistence hunting and gathering
Hunting and gathering of wild animals has always been and continues to be an important aspect of life in rural African societies. In the past, hunting provided the main source of animal protein and professional hunters occupied a highly respected position in the society. Even in modern day Africa, some groups such as the Bushmen in southern Africa depend almost entirely on hunting and gathering to obtain essential protein and cash income, while many other groups supplement their livelihood considerably by hunting (see e.g. Richter and Butynski, 1973; Asibey, 1974; Ajayi, 1979; Infield, 1988; Tutu et al., 1994). In many African countries, hunting is not only a means of securing food resources, but is also a social event (rites of passage) in which young men proved their manhood.
Hunting with guns and bows is predominantly a male activity, but women and children also play a significant role in the hunting and collection of wild resources to feed the household. In south eastern Gabon, women and children set traps for small mammals and birds :in plantations (Lahm, 1993). Women of the Luvale and Shaba tribes of Zaire also trap rodents and in West Africa, snail collection is predominantly done by women and children.
In the past hunting and exploitation of wild animals were regulated by traditional rules and every good hunter was expected to respect the traditional code of conduct that existed in whatever community he operated in. With colonisation and the advent of modern wildlife conservation measures, many African governments have introduced restrictions on hunting. These restrictions include prohibition of hunting in national parks and other wildlife conservation areas, closed seasons in which hunting is prohibited, introduction of a license system and restrictions on species and age categories which could be taken. In many countries, hunters are required by law to take out a hunting license which normally stipulates the number of each species he is allowed to hunt over a specified period of time. In some countries, bushmeat traders are also required to take a license which permits them to trade. In southern and eastern African countries. these restrictions are strictly enforced to
ensure protection of wild animal both within and outside protected areas in order to promote tourism, sport hunting and other wildlife based revenue generating activities. Within West Africa, enforcement of hunting regulations is less stringent and is aimed at protection to allow wild animal populations to build up, since numbers of most species have already been drastically reduced by hunting. In most countries, hunting regulations concern large game species' a factor which explains the dominance of rodents and other small mammals in the species exploited as bushmeat.
Governmental controls do not normally apply to the collection of invertebrates such as insects and snails but in many African communities the collection of these groups of wild animals is governed by traditional rules and regulations. For example, in the southern forest areas of Ghana' particularly in Ashanti, an unwritten traditional law involving closed seasons exist which was highly respected in the past and effectively regulated the exploitation of the giant African snail Achatina achatina. The closed season for forest snails was strictly enforced in most Ashanti villages; at the beginning of the snail season when the snails were laying their eggs the town crier would inform the community of the ban on snail collection. This was aimed to allow hatching and growth of young snails . This was strictly adhered to until the season was opened by another announcement from the town crier.
Despite all the controls on hunting, subsistence hunting accounts for over 90% of the bushmeat supply on the African continent. In the Côte d'Ivoire bushmeat consumption in 1990 was estimated to be 83,000 tons valued at US$ 117 m, out of which only US$23 m came from commercial hunting Feer (1993). Several categories of hunters and hunting methods have been described by various authors based on number of hunters involved, time of day and the implements used. Thus we have individual and group hunting, hunting with guns, bow and arrow hunting, setting of traps, night hunting and day hunting. Within these groups, hunters may operate as full time professional hunters or as part-time hunters whose main occupation may be farming, artisans or people engaged in the government/public service.
In the past, flint-locks were used and these were made by local blacksmiths. Currently, 12 gauge shot guns as well as locally made and imported rifles are commonly used. Most professional hunters own a gun; part-time and young hunters may or may not have their own guns. It is common for a younger/part-time hunter to rent/borrow a gun from an older hunter and pay a portion of his catch for the use of the gun. Within a population of about 130 people in a village in north-eastern Gabon, the ratio of gun ownership was 1:6.5 persons (Lahrn, 1993). Traditional hunting methods in Nigeria include the use of home-made muzzle-loaders, setting traps and snares, use of dogs and use of fire to drive animals out (Afolayan, 1980; Martin. 1983). The weapons used by the Bushmen of southern Africa consist of a light metal or bone-tipped arrow, whose quiver is made from the roots of the quiver tree Aloe dichotoma, a tiny spear and a hunting club. A short but sturdy bow is used to fire the
arrow at close range. Bushmen daub their arrows with poisons extracted from roots, bark and berries of certain trees and also from the venom of snakes, spiders and scorpions (Maliehe, 1993) Hunters in the Kiteto and Mbulu districts of the Arusha region in Tanzania also use poisoned arrows. The poison are obtained from extracts of various species of plants which may also be used to poison fish (Chihongo, 1992).
Hunters may hunt individually, often assisted by a helper, or in groups. Individual hunting may take place during the day or at night, in the forest or in secondary growth around farms. A professional hunter would leave his home in the morning for a day hunting expedition, returning in the evening. Many farmer-hunters share their day time between farm work and hunting or trapping. Dogs are commonly used to sniff out the wild animals,
Although illegal in many countries, night hunting is very common and very popular among professional hunters since the success rate is much higher. The hunter leaves his home after dark for the forest and normally hunts until day break before returning home. Night hunting is mostly a solitary affair although some hunters would use an assistant, a helper or someone to carry the kill. Most hunters normally restrict their night hunting activities to familiar grounds. A single hunter or two to three hunters in a group may also camp out in the forest -to hunt and would remain in the forest for periods ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks. The hunter constructs a hunting camp which is used as a base and hunting is done both day and night. The quarry is smoked and accumulated until the end of the hunt. Occasionally women buyers would travel from one camp to the next to buy meat but more commonly the hunter and his helpers would bring the meat to the village on market days.
A hunter's implements would include a gun, a small bag (often made out of animal skin) containing a supply of gun powder and cartridges, a cutlass or heavy knife and in the case of night hunters, also a powerful lamp which is carried on the forehead. The hunting lamp is a special device made from brass with a polished reflector and contains carbide. When water is dropped on the carbide, it produces acetylene which burns to give the strong light of the head lamp. The reflection of the lamp in the eyes of the wild animal enables the hunter to spot the animals. The strong light has the effect of dazzling the animals and the hunter is therefore able to approach them and shoot at close range.
Three main forms of communal hunting are common on the continent:
i) seasonal group hunting using guns;
ii) combing of vegetation to drive out animals which are then killed with clubs and cutlasses; and
iii) the use of fire to smoke out animals.
Traditionally, the seasonal group hunt was carried out at specific times of the year or as part of the celebrations associated with a particular cultural event and would commonly involve most of the able-bodied males in the community. Among the Ashantis living in forest areas of Ghana, the seasonal group hunting is a highly organised event. A meeting is held several days before the hunt to decide on the hunting grounds, divide people into ranks and share out responsibilities. As many as 60 - 100 people may be involved in the hunting, comprising professional hunters and helpers as well as a number of dogs.
Hunting by combing of vegetation involves fewer people. perhaps four or five. They encircle a patch of vegetation known to harbour animals and work towards the centre beating and slashing the bushes. Signs used to determine whether or not a patch of vegetation is likely to contain animals include presence of droppings and food remains. The method is popular for hunting rodents, especially the grasscutter in West Africa. Animals emerging from the vegetation are either chased and caught by dogs or killed with clubs and cutlasses.
The use of fire in group hunting is more common in the grassland savannah areas. Members of the group are positioned strategically around a patch of grassland known to contain wild animals. The area is then set on fire and animals are killed with cutlasses and clubs as they run out of the area to escape the fire. Within the forest areas fire is regularly used to smoke out rodents such as the giant rat Cricetomys gambianus from their burrows. A group of rat hunters would search for rat holes and set fire at the entrance using palm branches and dry leaves. The smoke penetrates the burrow and forces the rat to come out. In the mean time, members of the group would be waiting at strategic points around the burrow ready to kill the rat as soon as it comes out. Often the animal dies in the burrow out of suffocation from the smoke, in which case, it is dug out.
Most hunters who hunt with guns also set traps. Traps may also be set by farmers who do not hunt with guns and also by women and children. Two systems for setting traps are common on the continent:
i. the setting of traps in the forest in areas known to be used by wild animals or along animal trails and at feeding grounds. The sole aim of such traps is to catch mammals. Bird traps are normally placed among the top branches of trees known to be regularly used for feeding or roosting by birds. In the past hunters also set isolated traps in the forest comprising dug-out pits (pit-fall's), trenches and gin-traps. Such dangerous traps posed serious threats to people and are now prohibited.
ii. the setting of traps in and around farms: often a fence is constructed around a farm and traps are set at intervals along the fence. This system is primarily a crop protection measure and the primary objective is to reduce damage to crops by wild animals particularly rodents. Its value for providing the farmers with meat is however, quite substantial.
Snares may be designed as neck-traps, waist-traps and foot-traps depending on which part of the animal the noose is aimed at. A mixture of natural and man-made materials are used.
The most common material for making the snare or noose is steel wire, while natural fibers and stems are used to make the trigger and spring devices and also to anchor the snare. Foodstuffs such cassava, ripe plantain, banana and palm nuts are used as bait and are normally placed at the entrance of the traps to entice the animals. Traps around farms are inspected daily or as often as the farmer or his family visited the farm. Those set within the forest are normally inspected every other day. In most African communities, it is considered a very serious offence and a taboo for one person to tamper with or remove an animal from another person's trap.
The success of the different types of hunting methods vary, so does the species and sex composition of the catch. For example Lahm (1993) reports that trapping and night hunting had the greatest success rates for hunters in a village in north-eastern Gabon, and small nocturnal prey such as porcupines were more easily caught by snares. A number of duiker species may remain mesmerised by the hunting lamp, thus making them easy prey for night hunters. Arboreal species such as monkeys are highly unlikely to be caught in traps and all the monkeys killed in the Gabon village study were shot (Table 4.7).

The time spent on hunting varies from place to place and obviously on whether or not a hunter hunts on a full time or part-time basis and also on the success rates. The average number of hunting forays recorded in the Gabon study was 2.5 days per week. Infield (1988) recorded a mean of 16 hunting days per month by an average hunter in villages around the Korup National Park. Hunting in these villages was carried out all year round although its intensity declined during the farming season between December and March. In contrast. trapping was more intensive during the rainy season and each trapper set an average of 13;) traps. The Kumasi study (Tutu et al., 1993) showed that hunters hunted on average 2.08 times a week and each hunting foray lasted 4.42 hours (range 1 - 11 hrs). Average catch per hunting episode was one to four animals. In another area in Ghana, Akim Ayirebi, professional hunters spent an average of 22 - 30 hours per week hunting at night (Table 4.8).
Professional hunters depend on their stalking skills, experience, knowledge of the behavior of wild animals as well as a thorough knowledge of the forest within which they operate. However, hunters may also adopt a number of strategies involving the use of "magic", which are believed to either increase hunting success or offer protection for the hunter. Four such strategies are well known and have widespread use, but their effectiveness has not been studied.

Use of charms: a hunter may wear a ring on his finger or toe, a bracelet, a necklace or a talisman round his neck or a waistband around his waist, which is believed to improve hunting success by acting as a charm which draws animals towards the hunter.
Magic of transformation: this is another reported form of magical power which is supposed to confer the ability for a hunter to transform into an animal e.g., a hunter may transform into say a duiker or bushbuck. This then increases the chances of individuals of the same species coming closer to the hunter, which greatly improves the hunting success.
Invisibility powers: "magical" powers which makes a hunter invisible to a wild animal and the hunter is therefore able to approach the animal without being detected and is able to shoot at close quarters; this may involve a tail-whisk or a magical preparation which the hunter carries around and places on his head at the appropriate time.
Disappearance powers: this form of magic is aimed at protecting the hunter. It normally involves a long process of rituals comprising periods of confinement, bathing in a series of herbal preparations and living on a prescribed diet. After the initiation? the hunter may or may not be given a magical band which he wears. It is more common among old big game hunters. The process is believed to confer on the hunter the ability to disappear in the face danger e.g if a hunter is faced with a charging elephant, he might draw on such powers and disappear from the scene. The magic is invoked as soon as the hunter panics or when the hunters utters a word/phrase.
Sustainability of subsistence hunting
Considerable effort has gone into studies on hunting techniques and bushmeat exploitation by subsistence hunters in Africa, but very little effort has been put into assessing as to whether or not hunting methods and levels on the continent are sustainable. Wild animals continue to be increasingly exploited by a whole range of hunters from small scale subsistence hunters to powerful professional hunters and group hunters who organise hunting networks including arrangements for transport to city centres and marketing of the quarry. Despite the fact that populations of most wild animal species are declining as a result of over-exploitation and destruction of natural habitats, the quantity of bushmeat on sale in city markets does not seem to be decreasing. Feer (1993) contends that the ever-increasing availability of bushmeat on city markets is not because hunting is in balance with natural production rates but because the areas hunted are continually increasing, often intruding
into protected areas. Although animals may be locally scarce, hunters are prepared to go much further afield and spend more time on hunting expeditions to get decent quarry.
Intensive over-hunting is only profitable in the short term. In the longer term, exploitation over and above the productive capacity of wild animal populations will only lead to scarcity and animals will become too scarce for hunting to be profitable. Ecologically and economically. a more appropriate alternative would be to regulate hunting to sustainable levels while managing wild animals and their habitat for maximum productivity. In order to achieve this there would be the need to develop a simple methodology to measure sustainability of subsistence hunting in Africa. This becomes even more crucial under the changing face of conservation from strict preservation to addressing the needs of local people and the increased recognition of the role of subsistence hunters in wildlife protection.
Indices and models have been developed to provide preliminary measurements of hunting sustainability in tropical forests, although these are based mainly on Latin American examples (Robinson and Redford, 1991; 1994; Bodmer et al., 1993). Five such indices reviewed by Robinson and Redford (1994) are based on population density comparisons, population density declines; hunting yield comparisons; hunting yield changes and age structure comparisons. These indices allow the determination of whether the wild animal population production exceeds or is less than the harvest demand at a particular time. For example, in a study of game hunting in the Amazonian lowland forests. Bomer et al. (1993) found that the primates and the lowland Tapir Tapirus terrestris were over-harvested by the rural people in the Tahuayo region of the Reserva Communal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo in north-eastern Peru. Artiodactyls and large rodents were, however, not over-exploited. The authors therefore advocated
the cessation of hunting of over-exploited species and the setting of levels for artiodactyls and rodents as a means of ensuring sustainable use of the wildlife resources and protecting over-hunted species.
Determination and implementation of a sustainable level of hunting will yield considerable long term benefits to the conservation of Africa's wildlife resources and also to subsistence hunters for whom the wildlife resources provide their main source of livelihood. Data required for the determination of sustainable levels of exploitation would include:
o the intensity and variation in hunting patterns;
o the population status of game species;
o population turn over in individual game species and
o the response of game populations to hunting.
Such data unfortunately, are non-existent for many of the forests in Africa thus making it difficult to determine whether or not subsistence hunting is sustainable.
4.2.3. Bushmeat processing and marketing
Standards for bushmeat processing and marketing vary from one area to the other. On the one hand, the rules are so strict that it is almost impossible to meet the oconditions without huge capital investment on abattoirs and cold storage facilities. On the other hand. there are absolutely no rules or standards and the quality of bushmeat offered for sale on the markets varies widely. The latter is the situation prevailing within west African sates, where there are practically no rules regarding bushmeat processing and marketing.
While there may be standards set to ensure domestic meat hygiene in most west African states, these either do not seem apply to bushmeat or are totally ignored when it comes to bushmeat marketing and processing. Hunters kill animals and transport them long distances in sacks to market centres without any attention to storage conditions, often carcasses are carried on roof racks of public transport, exposed to the hot west African sun, and still sell them as "fresh" bushmeat. It is common for animals killed on night hunting trips to be kept till day break before the hunter sets off for the market centre, which means animals often get to the markets several hours after being killed. Animals caught in traps may stay in the traps for up to three days if trappers do not visit their traps regularly for one reason or other. Sometimes such carcasses are almost beginning to decompose, but they will be collected and either sold as "fresh" bushmeat or smoked for sale. There also seem
to be no standards for smoked bushmeat and it is common to find improperly smoked bushmeat offered for sale on the markets. Whether this is the result of the scarcity and high demand of bushmeat in the sub region or the strong preference for bushmeat and therefore anything is acceptable is not clear. There have also been no attempts to study the effects of prolonged storage of wild animal carcasses under inappropriate conditions on the quality of the meat or even the health hazards consumption of such meat pose.
In eastern and southern Africa, stringent standards are set and enforced for bushmeat processing and marketing to the extent that in some areas game meat production is seriously hampered by obstacles such as shortage or total lack of cold storage facilities. As far back as 1971/72 The Kenyan Government's Veterinary and Game Departments prescribed the following stipulations which were expected to be strictly adhered to for game meat processing in the Kekopey experiment (Blankenship et al, 1990)
o All carcasses were to be bled by severing the carotid arteries while the heart was still beating.
o If killed by shooting, only head or upper neck wounds were permissible. Body wounds automatically meant condemnation due to inadequate bleeding thus, risking contamination.
o Evisceration was to be within 60 minutes of slaughter. (Less time would be allowed for animals larger than gazelle and impala).
o Carcass bone temperatures should fall below 13°C (55°F) within 4 hours of slaughter, and below 3°C (8°F) within 16 hours. The fall in temperature to be continuous with no temporary gains.
o Processing of carcasses was to take place in dust and fly-free conditions
o Personnel working with skinned carcasses were required to be bathed, dressed in clean clothing, and to be free of disease or unhealed sores.
o Facilities for tool sterilization and hand washing for carcass processors must be made continuously available.
o A minimum supply of 33 liters of sterilized (chlorinated) water must be available per carcass handled.
o Carcasses and viscera must be inspected by a qualified meat inspector of the Veterinary Department immediately following evisceration
o Unweaned immature animals are considered unacceptable and should therefore not pass inspection.
o Transport inspected carcasses in dust-proof vehicles.
Approximately 7 % of the carcasses culled in the Kekopey and Suguroi experiment were rejected for reasons varying from infection with disease pathogens to body wounds (Table 4.9)

Apart from in-country requirements, there are also international veterinary restrictions on meat exports to markets in Europe and the United States of America which must be considered in advocating large scale production of bushmeat. A number of requirements have to be met if high-quality meat is to be produced (Blankenship et al, 1990). These include the following:
o Ideally, the animal should be kept calm and not subjected to the need for strenuous movement, as this can lead to raised meat acid levels and muscular dystrophy (Young 1975) which lower meat quality.
o The animal should be available for inspection for behavioral or postural evidence of disease that may be difficult to detect post-mortem.
o Slaughter should take place in hygienic surroundings to minimize bacterial contamination. It should be humane and cause as little damage to carcass tissues as possible.
o Post-mortem routines commence with severance of major blood vessels, usually the carotid arteries, before the heart ceases to beat. This allows the evacuation of most carcass blood, thereby reducing the volume of free liquids, through which bacteria spread quickly. This improves the keeping quality of a carcass.
o The alimentary tract is a large internal source of contamination and ideally should be removed from the carcass within minutes of slaughter.
o Rapid cooling inhibits bacterial and enzymatic decomposition of tissues.
o Both carcass and viscera should be inspected to ensure freedom of pathogens dangerous to man.
o Meat processing should start immediately after slaughter. Freezing, chilling cooking, canning, salting or any of the many forms of curing need to carried out under clean conditions to ensure a durable, hygienic product. Hides must also be treated immediately to ensure high quality product.
Such considerations are obviously difficult to obtain even with domestic stock in most parts of Africa, and would be almost impossible with wild animals anywhere on the continent without expensive inputs. Some advocates of wildlife utilisation for meat production reject these high standards of modern meat production as unnecessary. They point out that millions of domestic and wild animals are killed annually by farmers, hunters and sportsmen around the world and either eaten or sold for public consumption, without heed to official hygiene regulations or disease. The important issue however is the fact these requirements constitute the standards against which any bushmeat production will be judged and there is therefore an obvious need for extensive investment in equipment and research to overcome whatever limitations there are and/or to prove the safety of processing techniques currently used.

5.4. Wild animal domestication
5.1. Why bother about wildlife production
In the preceding chapters, it has been shown that wildlife is a significant source of food in Africa. All species of wild animals, ranging from insect larvae through rodents, antelopes and monkeys, are exploited for food and in a considerable number of cases in rural communities, wildlife constitutes the major or only source of animal protein available to the people. Bushmeat exploitation and consumption, however, is not dictated solely by lack of alternative meat sources, but arises from a complex combination of factors including also financial limitations, preference and cultural values. These factors underscore the value of wildlife to the people of Africa and the urgent need for investment in the development of the resource.
Data have also been presented on the contribution of wildlife to both household and national economies. Hunting and bushmeat trade provide the main source of income for a large net-work of people ranging from hunters and farmers to market women and helpers in both urban and rural communities. In many areas the gathering and marketing of wildlife, even species such as snails which may be considered to be of little value, provides a significant proportion of the household cash income and determines whether or not a child gets education. Wildlife based industries such as tourism, sport hunting and trade in wild animal products have been shown to be a major foreign currency earner in eastern and southern African countries, contributing significantly to the national economy and providing jobs for a large number of people.
Wildlife populations in many parts of the African continent are declining as a result of overexploitation and destruction of wildlife habitat caused by increasing human populations and the associated demands for agricultural lands and land for development of human settlements. Current levels of wild animal exploitation are not sustainable anywhere on the continent and areas where large populations of wildlife still occur coincide with the enforcement of protection measures. The low populations of wild animal species, particularly those of larger mammals, has led to a situation where in parts of West Africa where dependence on bushmeat is highest, people now resort to eating species which in the past were not acceptable as comestible. In these areas, although bushmeat is still very popular, it is inaccessible to those who in the past depended on this form of meat. For example in the surveys of contribution of bushmeat to the protein intake in Ghana (Ntiamoa-Baidu, unpbl.
data), the majority of the people interviewed answered in the affirmative when asked the question "do you eat bushmeat?'' (Doryum, 95.5% of responses; Accra, 92.5%; Mankesim, 86%;). In most cases, however, the answer will be followed by a statement like, "but I haven't eaten any for a long time because I cannot get it". It is clear that the diminishing wildlife resources on the continent has caused a general decrease both in the quantity of bushmeat available and in :its importance as a source of food for the rural population.
There is ample evidence that wildlife production is a feasible and viable form of land use in Africa, whether managed as wild populations in protected areas, farmed as wild populations on game ranches or intensive farms, or as domesticated species. In southern Africa where game ranching is most developed, the number of game ranches and total land area given to wildlife production has increased dramatically over the last decade. This is attributed to two factors: i) the change in ownership policies which granted land owners the responsibility to manage wildlife resources on their lands and permitted them to derive benefits from the wildlife and ii) the profitability of wildlife production. According to Martin (1994) wildlife on commercial farms in Zimbabwe began to increase only after farmers were granted user rights over the wildlife on their farms, and some farmers are reported to be reducing cattle numbers on their lands to allow introduction of high value species such as
Zebra (Muir 1989). Ostrich and crocodile farms are becoming more and more popular and are generating substantial income in a few countries. In western Africa, the feasibility of producing small wildlife species such as grasscutters, giant rats, guinea pigs and snails as possible alternative sources of animal protein to feed the household has been amply demonstrated.
The nutritional value of bushmeat is comparable to meat of domestic species in many respects and in some aspects such as low levels of fat, bushmeat is actually superior to many domestic species. Wild animals also possess several added advantages over domesticated species in terms of range usage, physiological and ecological adaptations to the African environment, disease tolerance and productivity. The rational underlying the advocacy for game production in Africa is that indigenous wild species have evolved within the African environment and should therefore be better suited to the conditions on the continent. The suggestion, however, is not to replace cattle, sheep or goats with wild animals; but to employ wild species which are indigenous to Africa in areas where they would be most productive and complementary. Many parts of Africa are unsuitable for domestic animal production and large tracts of savannah grasslands on the continent remain under-utilised. These marginal
lands hold considerable promise for wildlife production as a form of land use.
In terms of economic returns, there is a large body of data which indicate that net financial returns from wildlife production can far exceed what is possible from cattle ranching. The potential for increasing returns is also far greater for wildlife production than it is for cattle. The reason for the higher returns from wildlife is due to the fact that wildlife has added value and can be marketed for more than just meat and products such as skins. The highest potential return per unit land area is offered where the land is used for wildlife production for touristic use. It has been shown that the greater proportion of revenue from game ranching ventures comes from live animal sales, sport hunting and tourism, and not meat sales.
Many rural areas of Africa are plagued with chronic food shortages and malnutrition. The real problem is not so much scarcity of carbohydrate foods but inadequacy of high quality protein food supply. Kwashiorkor (a condition resulting from protein/calorie imbalance) is rife in Africa and in many areas the total animal protein intake is far below the recommended levels. Despite the heavy investment in conventional agriculture by governments, aid agencies and multilateral organisations, domestic livestock production has not succeeded in meeting the protein demands in Africa. The situation is compounded by the increasing human population pressure. Under these circumstances, all types of food and all food sources become significant and people in rural Africa today are actually exploiting most of the wild resources traditionally known to be edible. The situation in Africa clearly indicates that conventional forms of agriculture alone will not be sufficient to solve the growing
food insecurity and there is an urgent need to evolve more holistic and innovative strategies to address the lack of food security on the continent. This is where, the continent's wildlife resources hold much promise. Wildlife is contributing to food security in Africa and can contribute most effectively if adequate investments are made into production, marketing and research and technical support.
The value of wildlife as a resource has always been recognised by African people. The need to give recognition to wildlife production as a form of land use in its own right and the integration of wildlife into food production strategies on the African continent has been advocated by African governments and international organisations such as the FAO for decades (see for example Riney, 1964; 1967; 1979). Unfortunately, data to demonstrate exactly how much people depend on bushmeat as a food resource in Africa or the contribution of wildlife to African economies are woefully inadequate.
The question then is why is this so? Why have all the very convincing arguments on the feasibility of developing wildlife as a resource to compliment conventional forms of food production not been pursued more vigorously? Is it lack of political will, lack of required resources or simply lack of conviction about the potential of wildlife to effectively contribute to food security? In the concluding sections of this document, we discuss the potential of the three main wildlife production systems (protected area management, game ranches and wild animal domestication) in different parts of the continent. Issues which are considered crucial in the development of the potential of wildlife to contribute to the attainment of food security on the African continent are also highlighted.
5.2. Production from wild populations
McNeely e' al. (1994) estimate that 240 million ha of land in Africa south of the Sahara is under protection. Although this figure includes forest reserves with nature protection functions, it does not include the numerous reserves and other state lands whose primary aim for protection may not be wildlife conservation but which have obvious biodiversity conservation functions and which often hold large numbers of wildlife. This means that a substantial portion of sub-Saharan Africa is under some sort of protection and has potential for management for wildlife production. The system advocated requires the enhancement of the management of protected areas in Africa for the realisation of their full potential both in terms of biodiversity conservation and meeting the needs the people in Africa.
The objectives of establishment of various categories of protected areas in Africa during the colonial era included the protection of wildlife resources either for the sake of conservation, or to preserve spectacular wild animal species which had perceived aesthetic values. Some forest reserves, on the other hand, were established for timber production, while others had the objective of protecting ecological processes such as hydrology and local climatic conditions. The needs of the local people who lived with the wildlife and whose livelihood were inter-linked with the resources available in their natural environment were certainly not part of the equation and the protective strategies pursued often actively sought to keep the people away from the wildlife and timber resources in some cases. Hunter-gatherers became poachers overnight and were denied access to lands which were theirs by right and on which they and their ancestors had lived. This situation naturally led to
antagonism and in some cases very serious conflicts between local communities and government wildlife officials. In some areas local people were made to feel people who ate bushmeat were of low-status. The strategy succeeded in closing off an important food sources in many parts of Africa particularly in the eastern southern African countries. Unfortunately, for many of the rural communities in these areas, the system did not provide adequate alternatives with the end result that such rural communities lost essential dietary items which in the past ensured a balanced diet. In other areas, notably western Africa, the system failed completely to stop people from using protected resources, in actual fact in some areas hunting was intensified as soon as an area was declared as protected. People in these areas still depend heavily on wild resources which continue to be exploited at a rate that is clearly unsustainable. The present level of exploitation and use of wildlife
resources, if allowed to continue, will not only lead to loss species, habitats and biodiversity but to loss of productive systems and resources vital to rural communities in Africa.
A high proportion of protected areas in Africa exist on paper with little or no protective or management activities on the ground. In-country resources are woefully inadequate and with such limited resources and the many other more pressing national socio-economic problems. it becomes virtually impossible for African governments to pay adequate attention to wildlife conservation and protected area management. The degree of priority given to protected area management in national budgetary allocatiuons might, however, change if wildlife production was recognised as a form of land use in its own right and as an activity which can contribute to national development and the improvement of the quality of life for people.
The value of wildlife resources in a well managed protect area has been amply demonstrated by projects in countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe. These projects have proven that wildlife is can pay its way, contribute significantly to national economies and also provide benefits to enhance the living standards of rural communities. The focus of these projects. however has been on high income generating activities: recreational use and tourism. This is all well and good, but the question is how many rural communities actually benefit directly from the income generated from these activities? Populations of a number of wild animal species in protected areas in these countries could sustain some exploitation. A typical example is the case of the elephants in South Africa's Kruger National Park, the proposed culling of which has created such a huge outcry from the some international conservation movements over the past year. What is interesting is that most of these
conservation activists act on their emotional attachment to animals. Some of them have never been to Africa, do not know and will never know what it means to have your crops, property and even the life of a family member destroyed by raiding wild animals, when you hardly have enough to eat.
What is needed therefore, is the creation of the appropriate policy environment and the establishment of institutional and technical structures which allow people to manage and use wildlife resources in protected areas sustainably, i.e., a system that will enable protected areas to contribute to development of food security in Africa. The big challenge is to use wildlife protection and protected area management as means to meet the needs of rural African populations. while ensuring the survival of Africa's biodiversity resources. The crux of the issue is that people in rural Africa use wildlife resources, they will continue to do so for a long time to come and therefore due recognition must be given to this in the quest to marry biodiversity conservation with sustainable development . Some of the critical steps that will have to be taken to get to this goal include:
i) Recognition of wildlife and protected area management by African policy and decision makers as a form of land-use in its own right.
ii) Long term commitment by African governments and donor agencies to protected area management and provision of adequate resources for the effective management of these areas.
iii) Re-focusing of management objectives and goals to include addressing the needs of the local communities and evolving strategies for delivery of benefits.
iv) Revision of protected area management policies in appropriate categories of protected areas to permit sustainable exploitation of species whose populations can withstand exploitation, i.e., sustainable harvesting of wildlife resources from a totally non-domesticated system.
v) Creation of appropriate policies and enabling environments that encourage participation and involvement of local communities in the management of their wildlife resources. A number of projects around Africa are already experimenting with "people and government partnerships" in wildlife resource management, where the people are given responsibility for the resource and also derive direct benefits from the management of the resource.
vi) Developing of appropriate technology for sustainable harvesting, processing an marketing. There would be a need to re-visit the roots of African people and re-discover those indigenous harvesting techniques and regimes, including subsistence hunting systems, that ensured sustainability.
The system being advocated here is, obviously not going to be easy to implement or without problems. For example, there is no doubt that given the opportunity to hunt and gather resources from a hitherto protected area, people will tend to exploit at a level that meets their immediate needs without due consideration to future generations or issues of sustainability. There will therefore be a need for the development of strict controls for the harvesting including the establishment of quotas to be taken and effective systems for monitoring. In areas such as west Africa where animal populations are far from recovering from the heavy exploitation they have been subjected to in the past, sustainable harvest of wildlife from protected areas will remain a long term dream. Heavy investments in protection and management will be required before this dream becomes a reality, however, the Nazinga Game Ranch clearly shows that this is feasible.
5.3. Production from game ranches and game farms
Game ranches and farms have been amply proven to be feasible, viable and profitable and with a lot of potential for increasing returns in many areas in Africa. The cattle industry has been heavily supported in most countries in terms of production, marketing and even consumption (as in the case of some countries where the price of beef is subsidised by central government) and therefore has more attraction to farmers. It is clear, however, that wildlife can compete favourably with cattle production in Africa if the necessary investments are provided. In the longer term the inherent biological, ecological and physiological advantages of wild animals, and the fact that wildlife has added value in terms of products other than meat, may make wildlife production more profitable than beef in many areas in Africa.
What is required now for the full realisation of the potential of game ranches in Africa are:
o the political will;
o long term financial support from donor agencies;
o the wooing of private businessmen to invest in wildlife production ventures;
o research into and development of and transfer appropriate technologies in management, harvesting and processing techniques;
o development of appropriate infrastructure for storage and marketing that meets international meat marketing requirements.
Production of good quality products (meat, skins etc.) which can be marketed for high financial returns would obviously require heavy capital investment and special technical support. The potential financial returns from high quality goods marketable in western countries and the benefits of improved protein production locally, certainly justifies the capital investment required. It is suggested that organisations which are charged with the fostering of global food security focus more of their development and research efforts on sustainable wildlife production.
5.4. Wild animal domestication
Within the west African sub-region, the tradition of bushmeat consumption is firmly established and bushmeat is the favourite meat of a large number of people. Prices of bushmeat are known to be higher than domestic meat in most areas, and the indications are that there is an unlimited market bushmeat. Under these circumstances managing small, prolific wild animal species for meat production purposes offers high prospects and may be even more profitable than conventional livestock. The feasibility and economic viability of farming species such as grasscutters and the African giant snails has been well demonstrated. The rationale is to farm such species in captivity for the purposes of producing cheap, readily available meat to feed local communities and also possibly for sale. The advantages of these farming systems is that they can be undertaken in people's backyards, thus providing a readily available food source, and the fact that the unit size of the animal is small
enough to be used for a single household meal without the problems of storage. Issues requiring attention in this area include:
o the development and transfer of technical knowledge (including care of animals, handling, diseases etc.,) to farmers:
o development of cheap production methods, including housing and feed;
o establishment of a system of extension services to support farmers.
The crucial issue here is to evolve production systems where the costs and efforts are much lower than what is required to obtain bushmeat through hunting and gathering and which will also yield returns that are comparable or even better than that which pertains in the traditionally accepted livestock industry. It may also be necessary that even at the low cost of production the initial capital investment required will have to be provided to rural communities as an incentive/encouragement for them to embrace such projects. Aspects of small wild animal production which still require research efforts include diseases, dry season feed, and in the case of species being intended for domestication, development of breeding stocks to remove reliance on re-stocking from wild captures.
In conclusion, what can we say to the question posed in the title of this Chapter: can wildlife contribute to food security in Africa? Wildlife has always contributed and continues to contribute significantly to the socio-cultural and economic life of rural African communities, as a food resource, as a source of employment and income and as a source of medicines. Wildlife does indeed contribute to the nutritional well-being of people in Africa, and can be made to contribute more significantly to the attainment of food security on the continent if adequate investment is made in the areas of research and technology development establishment of appropriate institutional structures and policy environment; and development of appropriate harvesting and marketing systems.
Different wildlife production systems may be more feasible and/or more appropriate in specific areas on the Africa continent and we should not expect that any one particular approach will provide the answer to Africa's food problem. However, there are a number of basic issues which require to be addressed in order to realise the full potential of wildlife as a factor in the search for food security in Africa. These issues include:
o land tenure systems and evolution of systems that allow people control over land and access to wildlife resources on the land;
o economic incentives to people for sustainably managing wildlife on their lands;
o development of enabling policies;
o equity in revenue sharing;
o Iong term commitment and significant investment into the development of sustainable wildlife production systems;
o the willingness of donor agencies to invest substantially in wildlife research.
In addition to research into appropriate techniques for sustainable production, harvesting and marketing other areas where research effort are urgently needed include assessment of the current usage and dependence of people on wildlife as a food resource, the contribution of wildlife to national economies; sustainable levels for subsistence hunting and potential levels of production from wild sources.
These are some of the areas where the Food and Agriculture Organisation has a role to play! in encouraging and supporting the establishment of wildlife production systems in the context of rural development; promoting research into problems related to wildlife production and mobilising African governments and donor agencies to provide the long term commitment and financial resources required.
